Subject: GG LOOP is LIVE - Your Feedback Needed 🎮

Hey [First Name],

Quick update: GG LOOP's payment system is finally working. You can now subscribe and unlock premium features.

**What's New:**
- PayPal subscriptions active ($5-25/month)
- Premium tiers with point multipliers
- Exclusive rewards for subscribers
- Desktop app improvements

**Honest request:**
You're one of our first 5 users. Your feedback is critical.

Before you subscribe (or don't), I need to know:
1. What's working for you?
2. What's broken or frustrating?
3. What would make you pay for this?

**Special Founder Offer:**
First month free if you subscribe this week. Just reply to this email and I'll send you a code.

Not a sales pitch - genuinely want to build something you'd actually use.

Thanks for being part of the early days.

Founder, GG LOOP

P.S. - If this isn't valuable to you, totally fine. Just let me know what WOULD be valuable.
