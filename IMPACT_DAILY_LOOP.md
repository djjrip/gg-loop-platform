## REVENUE LEVERS (PULL WHEN NEEDED)

### Lever 1: Increase Posting Frequency
**When:** Revenue is growing, engagement is high  
**How:** Post 2x per day instead of 1x  
**Risk:** Audience fatigue, lower engagement per post  
**Test:** Try for 1 week, monitor engagement

### Lever 2: Add New Platform
**When:** TikTok is maxed out (10k+ views per post)  
**How:** Repurpose TikToks for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts  
**Risk:** Diluted focus, more work  
**Test:** Start with Instagram Reels, same content

### Lever 3: Integrate into GG LOOP Site
**When:** $500+ revenue per month from TikTok/Discord  
**How:** Create "Deals" section on ggloop.io  
**Risk:** Code changes, CEO approval needed  
**Test:** See IMPACT_ROADMAP_LITE.md Stage 2

### Lever 4: Email Newsletter
**When:** 1,000+ Discord members or 5k+ TikTok followers  
**How:** Weekly "Top Deals" email with affiliate links  
**Risk:** Spam complaints, unsubscribes  
**Test:** Start with bi-weekly, monitor open rate

### Lever 5: Paid Ads
**When:** $1,000+ revenue per month organically
