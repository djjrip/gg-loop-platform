# Discord Lead - Response Template

Hey Johnnym! 👋

Appreciate you reaching out - always excited to connect with builders in the gaming space.

**Quick context on GG LOOP:**
We're building a gaming rewards platform that lets players earn real value for their gameplay. Currently live with desktop verification for 17+ games, PayPal subscriptions, and a shop with real rewards.

**Would love to learn more about what you're building:**
- What's your product/platform called?
- What's your take on the gaming rewards space?
- Are you thinking integration, white-label, or something else?

Down to jump on a quick call this week if that works better than DMs.

Looking forward to connecting!

## If They're a Competitor (Friendly Approach)

Hey! Always cool to see others building in this space.

Even if we're working on similar things, there's probably room to collaborate - whether that's sharing best practices, integration opportunities, or just comparing notes on what works.

What's your product? Would love to see what you're building.
