# HOMEPAGE UPGRADE PLAN
**Objective:** Align `Home.tsx` with the new "Choose Your Sponsor" brand identity.
**Constraint:** NO CODE CHANGES (Documentation Only).

## 1. HERO SECTION
*   **Current:** "PLAY. EARN. LOOP." (Keep this, it is strong).
*   **Subheadline Change:**
    *   *From:* "The gaming rewards platform built for the culture..."
    *   *To:* "The first platform that lets you 'Sign' with a sponsor. Grind games. Rep the brand. Earn real gear."
*   **CTA Update:**
    *   *Primary:* "CHOOSE YOUR SPONSOR" (links to /subscription or /signup)
    *   *Secondary:* "JOIN DISCORD" (Keep as is)

## 2. VALUE PROPS (THE "WHY")
Replace the generic "Play/Earn/Redeem" with the new narrative:

*   **Card 1: SIGN A DEAL**
    *   *Icon:* Pen/Signature
    *   *Copy:* "Don't just play for free. Select a Brand Sponsor (like Nike or Logitech) on Day 1 and unlock their reward track."
*   **Card 2: PROVE YOUR WORTH**
    *   *Icon:*  Chart/Graph
    *   *Copy:* "Complete daily missions and competitive challenges. Your stats turn into currency."
*   **Card 3: GET THE GEAR**
    *   *Icon:* Box/Package
    *   *Copy:* "Redeem your grind for the exact gear, gift cards, and cash payouts you actually want. No crypto. No fluff."

## 3. SOCIAL PROOF (New Section)
*   **Heading:** "BUILT FOR THE CULTURE"
*   **Content:**
    *   "Founded by competitive gamers & hoopers."
    *   "Manual Verification = Real Humans, Not Bots."
    *   "Early Access: Join the first wave of signed players."

## 4. FOOTER CLEANUP
*   Remove any "Coming Soon" dead links.
*   Ensure "Partners" link goes to the new `/partners` page.
