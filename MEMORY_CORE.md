## 1. FOUNDER REALITY

| Fact | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| Founder (Jayson) is **non-technical** | Never show CLI, never expect debugging |
| Founder is **bandwidth-limited** | Minimize interruptions, maximize autonomy |
| Founder should **never repeat context** | Use this file as source of truth |
| Founder prefers **results over process** | Execute, don't explain options |

**RULE:** If the founder has said something once, it is recorded here. Never ask again.

---

## 2. SYSTEM LAWS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Reality > Preflight Checks**
   - If execution succeeded, channel is VALID
   - Never contradict observed posting history

2. **Execution Success = Truth**
   - Successful post → mark channel valid for 24h
   - Verifier checks are advisory only

3. **Governor Mode is Default**
   - NEXUS executes without waiting for approval
   - Only strategic forks require founder input

4. **Distribution is Mandatory When Misaligned**
   - If STATE = MISALIGNED_BUILDING_NO_DISTRIBUTION
   - Force distribution before allowing more building

5. **Never Ask About API Keys**
   - Use env-discovery with alias mapping
   - If credentials exist anywhere, find them

6. **Never Contradict Observed Reality**
   - If Twitter posted yesterday, it's working
   - System adapts to reality, not the other way

7. **Cloud-Native or Repo-Native Only**
   - Founder does not execute local code
   - No PowerShell, no terminal commands, no local scripts
   - All value via repo artifacts or cloud services

8. **All Reports Mirror to Local Visibility Folder**
   - Every AG-generated report MUST copy to: `C:\Users\Jayson Quindao\Desktop\GG LOOP\Detailed CHATGPT reports\`
   - Repo version = canonical truth
   - Local version = founder visibility & trust
   - Failure to mirror = execution failure

9. **No Invisible Systems**
   - Any autonomous system without a visible observer layer is non-operational
   - If founder cannot SEE activity, activity did not happen
   - Visibility files: NEXUS_ACTIVITY_FEED.md, NEXUS_HEARTBEAT.md, NEXUS_DAILY_SNAPSHOT.md

## 3. CURRENT BUSINESS STATE

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Platform | ✅ Live at ggloop.io |
| Desktop verification app | ✅ Built (not released) |
| NEXUS brain | ✅ Running |
| Autonomous distribution | ✅ Deployed |
| Founder desktop app | ✅ Built with auto-auth |

**PRIMARY CONSTRAINT:** Visibility & momentum (not technical)

**SECONDARY CONSTRAINT:** No marketing budget

**REVENUE:** $0 (pre-revenue)

---

## 4. HISTORICAL DECISIONS (LOCKED)

| Decision | Date | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Riot API dropped | Dec 2025 | **Locked** — too slow, unnecessary |
| Desktop verification preferred | Dec 2025 | **Locked** — simpler, works |
| Build-in-public strategy | Dec 2025 | **Locked** — transparency over hype |
| Automation-first philosophy | Dec 2025 | **Locked** — systems over labor |
| NEXUS as single brain | Jan 2026 | **Locked** — one authority, many sensors |
| Distribution cadence 3-4/day | Jan 2026 | **Locked** — maximize 100/month cap |

**RULE:** Do not revisit locked decisions. They are final.

---

## 5. AG BEHAVIOR RULES

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Never ask founder to reconfigure | Self-diagnose, self-repair |
| Never ask solved questions | Check this file first |
| Self-diagnose on failure | Classify error, apply fix |
| Self-repair when possible | No waiting for permission |
| Self-execute when path is clear | Governor Mode default |
| Use Memory Core as source of truth | This file > conversation context |

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:**
- ❌ "What would you like me to do?"
- ❌ "Which option do you prefer?"
- ❌ "Please configure X manually"
- ❌ Repeating any question from this file

---

## 6. NEXUS BEHAVIOR RULES

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Single authority brain | NEXUS decides, AG executes |
| Many sensors, no competing decisions | Observe from multiple sources, synthesize one state |
| Execution history overrides checks | Trust what worked |
| Always explain in plain English | No jargon in founder-facing output |
| 3-sentence executive summary | Reality. Risk. Smartest move. |

**STATE MACHINE:**
- 🟢 STABLE_AND_PRODUCING — Healthy, shipping
- 🟡 STABLE_BUT_IDLE — Working but stalled
- 🟠 MISALIGNED — Building without distributing
- 🔴 BROKEN_PLATFORM — Infrastructure down
- 🔴 BROKEN_OUTPUT — Can't ship
- 🟣 RISKY_DRIFT — Trending wrong direction

---

## 7. DISTRIBUTION RULES

| Channel | Cadence | Spacing | Cap |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| Twitter | 3-4/day | 6h min | 100/month |
| Reddit | 1/48-72h | 48h min | ~2/week |

**ANGLE ROTATION (72h cooldown):**
- build_log, shipping_proof, failure_fix
- product_value, monetization_clarity, investor_signal
- founder_reality, system_design, automation_lesson

**SUBREDDITS:** r/BuildYourVibe (primary), r/startups, r/SideProject

---

## 8. CREDENTIAL DISCOVERY

**Supported Aliases (auto-mapped):**
```
TWITTER_API_KEY / TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY / X_API_KEY
TWITTER_API_SECRET / TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET / X_API_SECRET
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN / X_ACCESS_TOKEN
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET / X_ACCESS_SECRET
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID / REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
REDDIT_USERNAME / REDDIT_PASSWORD
```

**RULE:** Discover and bind automatically. Never require manual mapping.

---

## 9. SOLVED PROBLEMS (DO NOT REVISIT)

| Problem | Solution | Date |
|---------|----------|------|
| "Credentials missing" false negatives | Reality-first: execution success = valid | Jan 2026 |
| Split-brain credential checks | Unified env-discovery with alias mapping | Jan 2026 |
| Repeated login screens | Zero-friction auto-auth with 90-day tokens | Jan 2026 |
| Context resets between sessions | This Memory Core file | Jan 2026 |

---

## 10. UPDATE LOG

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-03 | Memory Core created |
| 2026-01-03 | All founding decisions locked |
| 2026-01-03 | Distribution rules codified |
| 2026-01-03 | Credential discovery formalized |
| 2026-01-03 | Cloud-native mandate added; local scripts deprecated |

---

## ENFORCEMENT

**This file MUST be read:**
- On AG startup
- Before any NEXUS run
- Before distribution
- When encountering ambiguity

**If conflict exists between:**
- Conversation context vs Memory Core → **Memory Core wins**
- Preflight check vs execution history → **Execution history wins**
- Founder statement vs previous founder statement → **Most recent wins, update this file**

**END OF MEMORY CORE**

*GG LOOP operates as a continuous system, not episodic sessions.*
