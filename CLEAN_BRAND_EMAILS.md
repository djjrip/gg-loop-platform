## 1. LOGITECH G (Gaming / Tech)
**Contact:** creators@logitech.com
**Angle:** "Logitech Rookies" - Player Identity

### EMAIL 1: The "Setup Grind" Pilot (Proposing a Test)
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Logitech G
**Body:**
Hi Logitech G creators team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - an early-stage gaming rewards platform where competitive players earn rewards for their grind.

**Quick context:**
*   Building a dedicated community of competitive gamers.
*   Strong focus on setup upgrades (mice, keyboards, headsets).
*   Filipino-American founder, former hoops player, gaming grinder.
*   Honest brand: manual fulfillment, real rewards, no crypto/NFT hype.

**Why Logitech G:**
Your gear is what our community is grinding towards. We want to reward that dedication with the exact products they aspire to own.

**The Proposal: "Choose Your Sponsor"**
We're testing a new onboarding concept: players pick a brand sponsor when they sign up (like an NIL deal). They become "Logitech Rookies," earn brand-specific points, and work toward Logitech rewards. It’s player identity meets brand loyalty.

**Proposed 30-Day Pilot:**
We'd like to co-design a small test with you:
*   **Activity:** Gaming missions (any game, any rank).
*   **Rewards:** A limited pool of Logitech G peripherals (size/budget TBD by you) for top performers.
*   **Goal:** Measure engagement and conversion in a controlled environment.

**What you get:**
*   Engagement data from a focused gaming demographic.
*   Brand loyalty from players "signing" with you.
*   No long-term commitment - just a pilot to test the waters.

I’m looking for a partner to test this "NIL for Gamers" concept. Are you open to a 15-minute chat to discuss fitting this into your creator strategy?

Best,
Jayson BQ
Founder, GG LOOP LLC

### EMAIL 2: Follow-Up (Value Focus)
**Subject:** Re: Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Logitech G
**Body:**
Hi Logitech G team,

Following up on the "Choose Your Sponsor" pilot proposal.

I know you get a lot of partnership requests. What makes GG LOOP different is the "NIL" angle—players aren't just earning points; they are *identifying* with your brand as their sponsor from Day 1.

We can start very small. Even a micro-pilot with a handful of rewards would give us valuable data on how deep brand affinity goes when gamified this way.

Are you open to discussing a small test?

Best,
Jayson BQ
Founder, GG LOOP LLC

### EMAIL 3: Final Follow-Up (The "No" is Okay)
**Subject:** One last check: GG LOOP pilot?
**Body:**
Hi Logitech G team,

Checking in one last time. If it's not the right time for a pilot, I completely get it.

We're going to proceed with building the "Choose Your Sponsor" feature because the community loves the concept. I'd love for Logitech G to be an official launch partner, but we'll respect your timing.

I'll keep you updated on our growth. Hope we can work together down the line.

Best,
Jayson BQ

## 2. TARGET (Retail)
**Contact:** partnerships@target.com
**Angle:** "Target Run" - Everyday Ritual

### EMAIL 1: The "Target Run" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Target
**Body:**
Hi Target partnerships team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - an early-stage rewards platform for budget-conscious gamers.

**Quick context:**
*   Growing community of gamers (18-34 demographic).
*   High interest in retail gift cards for games, snacks, and gear.
*   Honest brand: real rewards, manual fulfillment.

**Why Target:**
Your gaming section is growing, and our community already shops there. We want to make "Target Runs" a reward for gaming achievement.

**The Proposal: "Choose Your Sponsor"**
We're building a system where players pick a sponsor upon signup. They become "Target Rookies," earning points specifically toward Target gift cards. It turns your brand into their meaningful progress partner.

**Proposed 30-Day Pilot:**
*   **Activity:** Daily gaming missions.
*   **Rewards:** A modest pool of Target gift cards (budget TBD by you).
*   **Goal:** Drive foot traffic and digital redemption to Target.

**What you get:**
*   Insight into gamer shopping habits.
*   Direct attribution from game-time to checkout.
*   A low-risk way to test gamified loyalty.

Open to a brief call to see if this fits your current partnership goals?

Best,

## 3. CASH APP (Fintech)
**Contact:** creators@cash.app
**Angle:** "Get Paid to Play"

### EMAIL 1: The "Cash Grind" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Cash App
**Body:**
Hi Cash App creators team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - a gaming rewards platform for competitive players.

**Quick context:**

*   "Cash is King" - our users value direct financial rewards above all else.
*   Strong alignment with the creator economy.

**Why Cash App:**
You are the gold standard for peer-to-peer and creator payments. Our gamers want to "get paid to play," and Cash App is the most trusted way to do that.

**The Proposal: "Choose Your Sponsor"**
Players select Cash App as their sponsor on signup. They become "Cash App Rookies," unlocking the ability to cash out their rewards directly to their $Cashtag. It's the "NIL deal" experience for aspiring pros.

**Proposed 30-Day Pilot:**
*   **Activity:** High-skill competitive missions.
*   **Rewards:** A small pool of cash payouts (budget determined by you) for top performers.
*   **Goal:** Drive Cash App adoption and usage in the gaming space.

**What you get:**
*   Direct access to the gaming/creator demographic.
*   Data on gamified fintech adoption.
*   Low-risk entry: we can cap the pilot pool to whatever you're comfortable with.

## 4. NIKE (Sneaker)
**Contact:** media.relations@nike.com / (LinkedIn sourcing recommended)
**Angle:** "Just Do It" - Performance

### EMAIL 1: The "Performance" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Nike
**Body:**
Hi Nike brand team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP - a gaming rewards platform built on competition and culture.

**Why I'm reaching out:**
I'm a former hoops player and Filipino-American founder building a bridge between basketball culture and gaming. Nike owns the court; we want you to own the server.

**The Proposal:**
We're launching a "Choose Your Sponsor" feature. Players sign with a brand (like an athlete) and earn rewards. We want to pilot a "Nike Athlete" tier where gamers earn points toward gift cards or gear by grinding competitive matches.

**Proposed Pilot:**
*   **Concept:** "Train Like a Pro."
*   **Rewards:** Small pool of Nike gift cards (budget TBD).
*   **Goal:** Reinforce Nike's dominance in competitive lifestyle vs. just "sports."

We are early-stage but authentic. I'd love to share more about how we connect the grind of gaming with the spirit of sport.

Open to a conversation?

Best,
Jayson BQ

## 5. JORDAN BRAND (Sneaker)
**Contact:** (Research regional reps)
**Angle:** "Earn Your Wings"

### EMAIL 1: The "Flight" Pilot
**Subject:** Proposal: Jordan Brand × Gaming Culture
**Body:**
Hi Jordan Brand team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP. I grew up on the court, and now I'm building for the digital court.

**The Vision:**
Competitive gamers share the same DNA as hoopers—obsessive practice, style, and the drive to win. I'm building GG LOOP to reward that grind, and there is no higher status symbol than the Jumpman.

**The Proposal:**
We are testing a "Choose Your Sponsor" model. Gamers sign as "Jordan Athletes" on our platform. They grind meaningful stats to earn rewards (gift cards/gear).

**Proposed Pilot:**
A limited test where a select group of gamers can "Earn Their Wings" through in-game achievements, unlocked by a small reward pool provided by you (or funded by us with your permission to use the name).

We are building a community that respects the legacy. I'd honor the chance to present this concept.

Best,
Jayson BQ

**Angle:** "Impossible is Nothing"

### EMAIL 1: The "Three Stripes" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Adidas
**Body:**
Hi Adidas partnerships team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP. We are building a rewards platform for the next generation of competitive gamers.

**Why Adidas:**
You’ve been aggressive in the digital/metaverse space. We offer something more grounded: real rewards for real gameplay.

**The Proposal:**
"Choose Your Sponsor." Gamers sign with Adidas upon joining GG LOOP. They represent the Three Stripes in our ecosystem, earning points toward Adidas gift cards.

**Proposed Pilot:**
A 30-day "Creator's Game" pilot.
*   **Activity:** Creative and competitive gameplay missions.
*   **Rewards:** Limited pool of Adidas gift cards.
*   **Goal:** deepen brand affinity with the gaming creator class.

We can structure this as a low-risk test. Open to a chat?

## 7. PUMA (Sneaker)
**Contact:** (Research regional reps)
**Angle:** "Forever Faster" - Speed/Agility

### EMAIL 1: The "Speed" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Puma
**Body:**
Hi Puma team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP.

**The Concept:**
Puma is about speed and culture (LaMelo, etc.). Gamers value speed (reaction time, FPS) just as much. We want to bridge that gap.

**The Proposal:**
We're launching a "Choose Your Sponsor" feature. We'd love to pilot a "Puma Speed" tier where gamers earn rewards based on high-paced performance in games like Valorant or Apex Legends.

**Proposed Pilot:**
*   **Rewards:** Small pool of Puma gift cards.
*   **Metric:** High-action gameplay.

It's a low-cost, high-culture play. Are you open to discussing?

Best,
Jayson BQ

## 8. RAZER (Gaming)
**Contact:** partnerships@razer.com
**Angle:** "For Gamers. By Gamers."

### EMAIL 1: The "Green Team" Pilot
**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: GG LOOP × Razer
**Body:**
Hi Razer team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io).

**Alignment:**
Your motto is "For Gamers. By Gamers." That’s us too. I'm a founder who plays. Our platform rewards the grind.

**The Proposal:**
We are testing a new "Choose Your Sponsor" onboarding. Players can pledge allegiance to "Team Razer" when they sign up. They earn points specifically to upgrade to Razer peripherals.

**Proposed Pilot:**
We'd strictly limit this to a small test group.
*   **Rewards:** A few units of Razer gear (or gift cards) provided by you.
*   **Goal:** Prove that brand loyalty drives higher engagement retention.

You have the cult following; we have the gamification. Let’s combine them.

Best,

We aren't trying to compete; we're trying to enhance the grind. We reward players for the hours they put into YOUR games.
