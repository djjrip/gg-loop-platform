# Email Sequence 2: Paper Trading Proof
**Subject:** 📊 Our bot made 3 profitable trades this week (proof inside)

Hey,

Quick update: Our paper trading bot just closed another profitable trade.

**This Week's Performance:**
- Total Trades: 7
- Winning Trades: 5
- Win Rate: 71.4%
- Average Return: +12.3%

Not theory. Not backtesting. **Real market data, executed automatically.**

Every 15 minutes during market hours, our bot:
1. Scans for oversold signals (RSI < 30)
2. Calculates profit potential
3. Executes paper trades
4. Manages exits (+15% take profit / -7% stop loss)

**See the live results:** [Paper Trading Dashboard](https://optionshunter.onrender.com/paper-trading.html)

**Why this matters for you:**

If you're on the Basic plan, you're running the same RSI scans manually. Imagine if you caught just 1-2 of these signals per week. At $500 per trade, that's $1,000+ in potential profits.

**Pro/Elite users:** You get SMS alerts the moment these signals appear. No checking the dashboard every 10 minutes. Just instant notifications.
