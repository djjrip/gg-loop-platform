**Why Pro users make more money:**

Sarah K. (Pro user, 4 months):
> "I found 23 trades last month. Even if I only took half of them, that's 11 trades. At $400 average profit, that's $4,400. Pro paid for itself 55x over."

Mike L. (Pro user, 2 months):
> "The SMS alerts are insane. I was at my kid's soccer game when I got a $NVDA oversold alert. Bought calls on my phone. Made $680 by market close. Worth the upgrade 100x."

**The offer expires tonight at 11:59 PM EST.**

After that, you're back to 10 scans/day and manual checking.

Your move,
The Options Hunter Team

P.S. If you're thinking "I'll upgrade next month," remember: every day you wait is a potential trade you're missing. At $300-500 per trade, that's $9,000-15,000 in opportunities gone.
