# Email Sequence 4: Urgency
**Subject:** ⏰ Your scan limit resets tomorrow (here's what you might be missing)

Quick question:

Have you been hitting your 10 scans/day limit on the Basic plan?

If yes, you're leaving money on the table.

**Here's the math:**

Let's say you find 1 good trade per week with your 10 daily scans. That's ~4 trades/month.

**Pro users** (unlimited scans) average **8-12 trades/month** because they can scan throughout the day.

At an average $300 profit per trade:
- Basic: 4 trades × $300 = **$1,200/month**
- Pro: 10 trades × $300 = **$3,000/month**

**Difference: $1,800/month**

Pro costs $79/month. You're potentially giving up **22x ROI** to save $50.

**But wait, there's more you're missing:**

✅ **SMS Alerts** (catch signals while you're away)
✅ **Priority Support** (get your questions answered in <1 hour)
✅ **Custom Watchlists** (track your favorite tickers automatically)

**Limited Time:** Upgrade in the next 48 hours and get your first month at Basic plan pricing ($29). That's $50 off.

[Upgrade to Pro - $29 First Month](https://optionshunter.onrender.com/pricing.html)

This offer expires in 48 hours. After that, it's back to $79/month.

Your choice:
- Stay at 10 scans/day and hope you catch the signals
- Upgrade for unlimited scans and catch 2-3x more opportunities

The traders making $3K-5K/month chose unlimited scans.

See you on the Pro side,
Options Hunter
