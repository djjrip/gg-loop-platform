**Jason T. | Pro Plan**
*Trading for 3 years, using Options Hunter for 2 months*

> "I used to blow up my account trying to catch 'cheap' options. Lost $2,400 in a single week buying calls on oversold stocks with zero volume.
>
> Options Hunter showed me something obvious I was missing: **liquidity**. The scanner filters for 1,000+ volume automatically. No more illiquid trash.
>
> First month: +$850 profit
> Second month: +$1,240 profit
>
> I'm up $2,090 and I've only taken 12 trades. The SMS alerts are clutch - caught a $TSLA signal while I was at work. Made $340 in 2 hours."

Jason's not unique. Here's what separates winning traders from everyone else:

**❌ Losing Traders:**
- Chase meme stocks
- Buy options with no volume
- Trade on emotions
- No exit plan

**✅ Winning Traders:**
- Use data (RSI, volume, profit calculations)
- Only trade liquid options (1,000+ volume)
- Have a system (entry + exit rules)
- Get alerts when opportunities appear

The difference? About $2,000/month in Jason's case.

P.S. Jason upgraded to Elite last week for the AI auto-execution. If you're consistently profitable, that's the natural next step.
