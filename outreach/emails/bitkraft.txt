SUBJECT: Pre-Seed Gaming Rewards Platform - GG LOOP

Dear BITKRAFT Team,

I'm Jayson Quindao, founder of GG LOOP LLC - a gaming rewards platform that's bringing the "NIL model" to competitive gamers.

**The Problem:**
Millions of competitive gamers grind daily with zero financial return. Traditional gaming rewards are either crypto-based (volatile, complex) or ad-driven (low engagement, bot traffic). Brands struggle to authentically connect with gaming audiences.

**Our Solution:**
GG LOOP lets gamers "sign" with sponsors like athletes do. Players choose a brand (Nike, Logitech, etc.), earn verified points through competitive gameplay, and redeem them for that brand's products. It's sponsorship at scale.

**Traction & Status:**
- Stage: Pre-seed, MVP complete, pre-launch
- Integration: Riot Games API (League of Legends, VALORANT, TFT)
- Verification: 4-layer system (automated, proof, fraud detection, manual review)
- Monetization: Subscription tiers ($5-$25/month) + brand partnerships
- Current Users: 0 (transparent pre-launch status)

**What's Built:**
✅ Full platform (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL)
✅ Riot API integration with match verification
✅ Fraud detection engine (6 detection types, risk scoring)
✅ Sponsor gating system (10K+ verified points required)
✅ Points engine with gameplay-based calculations
✅ 4-tier subscription model with monthly allocations

**10-Level Roadmap:**
- Level 4 (Current): Verification backbone
- Level 5: Desktop verifier app
- Level 6: Mobile app
- Level 7: Reward economy engine
- Level 8: Creator tools
- Level 9: GG LOOP Passport
- Level 10: Marketplace & GG LOOP OS

**Market Opportunity:**
- 3B+ gamers worldwide
- Esports audience: 500M+
- Gaming market: $200B+ annually
- Sponsorship gap: Gamers want brand deals, brands want authentic engagement

**Why BITKRAFT:**
Your portfolio (Discord, FaZe Clan, Overwolf) shows deep gaming expertise. We're building infrastructure that could integrate with your existing investments and unlock new revenue streams for competitive gaming.

**Ask:**
- Pre-seed funding discussion
- Strategic guidance on gaming partnerships
- Intro to brand partners in your network

**Transparency:**
We're pre-revenue with zero users. Our MVP is complete and verified. We're not pitching vaporware - everything mentioned is built and working. Beta launch targeted for Q1 2026.

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to share our pitch deck and schedule a brief call to discuss how GG LOOP fits into the future of gaming monetization.
