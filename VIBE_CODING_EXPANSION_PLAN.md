# ⚡ VIBE CODING EXPANSION PLAN

**Objective:** Pivot GG LOOP to reward **Builders** as well as Gamers.
**Core Feature:** "Build to Earn". Detect IDE usage (VS Code, Cursor) and award points for coding sessions.

---

## 1. The Strategy
We just launched `r/BuildYourVibe`. 
We need a product hook that speaks *directly* to that community.
**The Hook:** "GG LOOP now verifies your coding streaks. Get rewarded for shipping."

## 2. Technical Implementation
**File:** `client/src/lib/game-detection.ts` (or similar)
**Action:** Add detection signatures for:
- `Visual Studio Code` (`Code.exe`)
- `Cursor` (`Cursor.exe`)
- `Windsurf` (`Windsurf.exe`)

## 3. The "Vibe Board" (Future)
A live feed of users who are currently "Locked In" (coding or gaming). 
- "Jayson is Vibe Coding in Cursor (2 hours)"
- "Alex is playing League of Legends (45 mins)"

## 4. Execution Steps
1. [ ] Update Game Detection Logic
2. [ ] Add "Coding" category to supported games UI
3. [ ] Launch "Season 1: Builders" campaign

---
**Why this is 100% Innovative:**
No one else is paying you to code your own side project. We are.
This makes GG LOOP the *home* for the `r/BuildYourVibe` community.
