# 📣 Launching Substack: Building in Public

Hey Vibe Coders,

After 72 hours of intense campaign building, I realized something: the best content is the journey itself.

**Introducing: Vibe Coding on Substack**

Starting this week, I'm documenting everything:
- Every deployment failure (all 16 of them)
- Every $0 revenue update
- Every technical decision
- Every pivot and iteration

## First 3 Posts Are Ready

**Post 1: "From Bankruptcy to Production in 90 Days"**  
The full story. Chapter 7 bankruptcy → taught myself to code → built GG LOOP alone → deployed with 5 users and $0 revenue. No BS. Real numbers.

**Post 2: "72-Hour Campaign Launch: $0 to... Still $0"**  
Built landing page + VS Code extension + email automation + AI Twitter in 3 days. Spent 6.5 hours fighting Railway deployments. Results? Zero customers, zero comments. But the production URL works, and that's the win.

**Post 3: "Why I'm Paying Developers to Code"**  
The thesis: Gamers get paid to play. Why not developers? Testing if 1% of coders will pay $12/mo to gamify their flow state.

## Content Pillars

**Weekly:** Building in public updates  
**Bi-weekly:** Developer economics  
**Monthly:** Technical deep dives (ESM vs CommonJS anyone?)

## Why Subscribe?

If you're tired of fake startup metrics, polished launch stories, and "we hit $10k MRR overnight" BS, this is for you.

**Real failures. Real learning. Real numbers.**

**Substack:** [Coming Soon - vibecoding.substack.com]

First post drops this week. Join me on this chaotic journey from $0 to... hopefully not $0.
