## CULTURAL INTEGRATION GUIDELINES

### Tagalog Usage
- Use sparingly (1-2 words per post)
- Provide translation in parentheses
- Use common words (lola, pasalubong, marunong)
- Don't overdo it

**Good:**
```
"My lola (grandmother) taught me..."
"Bringing pasalubong (gifts) home..."
"Marunong magtipid (know how to save)..."
```

**Bad:**
```
"Kumusta ka na? Matagal na tayong hindi nagkita. Gusto ko pumunta sa Manila pero mahal ang ticket."
(Too much Tagalog, not accessible)
```

### Filipino Values
- **Family first:** Decisions benefit family
- **Bayanihan:** Community helping community
- **Diskarte:** Hustle, resourcefulness, optimization
- **Utang na loob:** Gratitude, paying it forward
- **Hiya:** Humility, not bragging

### Basketball/Hoops Culture
- Jayson's background: varsity basketball
- Competitive grind mentality
- Team-first approach
- Fundamentals over flashy plays

**Example:**
```
"Ranked grind = hoops grind. Same mentality: show up, put in the work, help your team."
```

### Sneaker Culture
- Streetwear + Filipino drip
- Budget-conscious but stylish
- Cop for retail, not resale
- Clean kicks = respect

**Example:**
```
"Budget sneakers that don't look budget. Same energy as flying to Manila for $287."
```
