## EXAMPLE POST OUTLINE

**Title:** "Hardstuck Plat → Diamond: What Actually Works"

**Hook:**
```
You're hardstuck Plat 3. You've watched every YouTube guide, practiced your aim for hours, and still can't break through.

The problem isn't your mechanics. It's your fundamentals.

Here's what actually got me from Plat 3 to Diamond 2 in two weeks.
```

**Section 1: The Problem**
- Most Plat players focus on aim
- Ignore positioning, economy, comms
- Copy pro plays without understanding why
- Blame teammates instead of self-improvement

**Section 2: What Actually Works**
1. **Fix Your Crosshair Placement** (not aim training)
   - Keep crosshair at head level
   - Pre-aim common angles
   - Practice in custom games, not deathmatch

2. **Learn One Agent, Master It**
   - Don't flex in ranked
   - 100 games on one agent > 10 games on 10 agents
   - Understand your role

3. **Economy Management**
   - Don't force buy
   - Coordinate with team
   - Save when you should save

4. **Comms That Matter**
   - Callouts only
   - No tilting
   - Mute toxic players instantly

5. **VOD Review (10 minutes/day)**
   - Watch your deaths
   - Identify patterns
   - Fix one mistake at a time

**Section 3: GG Loop Integration**
- Track your stats on GG Loop
- Earn points for ranked games
- Redeem for coaching sessions
- Join the Discord for VOD reviews

**Section 4: Action Steps**
1. Pick one agent, play 20 games
2. Record one game, review your deaths
3. Fix crosshair placement for one week
4. Track your rank progress on GG Loop
5. Share results in Discord

**CTA:**
```
That's it. No secret tricks, no shortcuts. Just fundamentals.

Try it for one week and let me know how it goes.
