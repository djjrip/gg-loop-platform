# GG Loop - Kickstarter Campaign Strategy

## 🎯 **Campaign Overview**

**Goal:** $25,000-$50,000 public funding goal (realistic for first-time campaign)  
**Duration:** 30 days  
**Launch Date:** February 2026 (best month for gaming projects)  
**Launch Time:** Tuesday, 7-10 AM EST

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL PRE-LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS**

### Before You Launch (3-6 Months)

**1. Product Positioning** ⚡  
- **NOT:** "Subscription service"  
- **YES:** "Gaming rewards platform software" (discrete product, not ongoing service)  
- Kickstarter prohibits pure service models - you need a **defined deliverable**

**2. Minimum Viable Community**  
- Build **1,000-3,000 email subscribers** before launch  
- Strategy: Landing page with $1 reservation deposits (30x better conversion than email-only)  
- Discord server with 500+ active gamers  
- Reddit presence on r/gaming, r/leagueoflegends, r/VALORANT

**3. Game Partnerships (CRITICAL)**  
- Get **signed agreements** with Riot Games for API access (ALREADY DONE ✅)  
- Show proof of partnerships in campaign to build credibility  
- Without this, your campaign = dead on arrival

**4. Working Prototype**  
- Show platform in action (ALREADY DONE ✅)  
- Demo video showing match verification, points earning, rewards redemption  
- Founder badge system and first 100 users (ALREADY DONE ✅)

## 💰 **Reward Tiers Structure**

### Avoid: Monthly Subscriptions (Kickstarter doesn't allow)
### Do: One-time platform access packages

| Tier | Price | What Backers Get | Limited? |
|------|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Early Bird Founder** | $15 | • 6 months platform access<br>• 1,000 bonus points<br>• Founder badge<br>• Beta access | 100 spots |
| **Founding Member** | $35 | • 1-year platform access<br>• 2,500 bonus points<br>• Founder badge<br>• Exclusive Discord role | 500 spots |
| **Elite Founder** | $75 | • 2-year access<br>• 5,000 bonus points<br>• Founder #1-100 badge<br>• Input on reward catalog | 200 spots |
| **Legendary Founder** | $150 | • Lifetime access<br>• 15,000 bonus points<br>• Custom profile badge<br>• Priority support | 50 spots |

**Pro Tips:**
- Show "Retail Value: $60/year" next to each tier (price anchoring)
- Add scarcity (limited spots create urgency)
- Bundle digital rewards (no shipping costs = higher margin)

## 🚀 **Marketing Strategy**

**Pre-Launch (2 weeks before):**
- Build lookalike audiences from email list
- Test creative (video > static images)
- Target: Gamers 18-30, League/Valorant players

**During Campaign:**
- Retarget website visitors who didn't pledge
- Different ads for cold/warm/hot audiences
- Expect 25-30% conversion improvement with retargeting

### 2. PR & Influencer Outreach

**Media Targets:**
- TechCrunch, Polygon, IGN, Kotaku, PC Gamer
- Gaming YouTubers/Streamers (10K-100K subscribers)
- Esports journalists and analysts

**Pitch Angle:**  
*"Turn Gaming Skills Into Real Money: Platform Lets LoL/Valorant Players Earn Gift Cards for Winning Matches"*

**Timing:** Coordinate coverage for first 48 hours (critical for algorithm boost)

### 3. Community Engagement

**Reddit Strategy:**
- AMAs on r/gaming, r/VALORANT, r/leagueoflegends  
- Transparently disclose you're launching a Kickstarter  
- Lead with value: "We built a platform that pays you for winning matches"

**Discord:**
- Daily updates during campaign
- Respond to EVERY comment within 24 hours
- Use backer updates to announce stretch goals

**Riot Games DevRel:**
- See separate DISCORD_PITCH.md for strategy

## 🎯 **First 48 Hours = Make or Break**

### Critical Success Metrics

- **Goal:** Hit 20-30% of funding in first 48 hours  
  - Projects passing 20% have **80% chance** of full funding  
  - Triggers Kickstarter algorithm boost  

**Email Blitz Strategy:**
1. **Hour 0:** Email entire VIP list (1,000-3,000 people)  
2. **Hour 6:** Post to Discord, Reddit, Twitter  
3. **Hour 12:** Influencer shoutouts begin  
4. **Hour 24:** Press coverage goes live  
5. **Hour 36:** Retargeting ads activated  

---

## 📹 **Campaign Video (MOST CRITICAL ASSET)**

### Script Structure (2-3 minutes)

**0:00-0:10** - Hook  
*"You've won 500 League of Legends matches. You earned... nothing. Until now."*

**0:10-1:10** - Problem + Solution  
*"GG Loop automatically verifies your wins via Riot API and awards you points. 10 wins = $10 Steam gift card. 50 wins = PlayStation subscription. Actually earn while you play."*

**1:10-1:40** - Proof  
*Demo: Show match win → auto-verification → points awarded → redeem reward*  
*Show founder badges, leaderboards, real user testimonials*

**1:40-2:00** - Team Credibility  
*"Built by gamers who were tired of grinding for nothing. Verified by Riot Games API integration."*

**2:00-2:30** - Call to Action  
*"Back us now and become a Founder. First 100 backers get lifetime founder badges and 1,000 bonus points. Campaign ends in 30 days."*

**Production Quality:**
- Hire a videographer ($500-$1,500)  
- Screen recordings of platform in action  
- Upbeat music, fast cuts, high energy

## 🎁 **Stretch Goals (Plan 3-5)**

Announce these as you hit milestones to maintain momentum:

- **$30K:** Add Twitch streamer integration  
- **$40K:** Mobile app (iOS/Android)  
- **$60K:** Crypto rewards option  
- **$75K:** Tournaments feature with prize pools  
- **$100K (aspirational stretch goal):** Expand to CS2, Dota 2, Fortnite  

---

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### 1. **Service vs. Product Framing**
❌ **BAD:** "Subscribe to our platform for $5/month"  
✅ **GOOD:** "Get 1-year access to gaming rewards platform"

### 2. **No Partnerships**
- Without Riot API proof, you look like vaporware
- Show screenshots of API approval emails

### 3. **Poor Communication**
- Update backers 2-3x per week
- Respond to EVERY comment (builds trust)

### 4. **Unrealistic Roadmap**
- Promise delivery in 6-12 months, not 3 months
- 70% of gaming campaigns deliver late - be realistic

---

## 📈 **Post-Campaign Checklist**

✅ Keep late pledge open for 30-60 days (+20-30% revenue)  
✅ Weekly backer updates during development  
✅ Deliver access codes by promised date  
✅ Award founder badges immediately after launch  

---

## 🚨 **Alternative: Consider Indiegogo Instead**

**Why Indiegogo might be better for GG Loop:**
- More flexible on ongoing services  
- Tech-heavy audience  
- InDemand feature = keep raising after campaign ends  

**Trade-off:** Lower gaming audience vs. Kickstarter

---

## 📞 **Next Steps (Start Today)**

1. ✅ **Founder Badge System** - DONE (first 100 users)  
2. **Build Landing Page** - Collect emails with $1 deposits  
3. **Create Campaign Video** - Hire videographer next week  
4. **Pitch to Influencers** - Reach out to 20 gaming YouTubers  
5. **Riot DevRel Outreach** - See DISCORD_PITCH.md

## 💡 **Pro Tips from $1M+ Campaigns**
