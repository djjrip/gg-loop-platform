I'm Jayson BQ — founder of GG LOOP LLC.
Reaching out human-to-human because we're building something for the players who never felt seen.

GG LOOP came from my life as a Filipino-American gamer raised on hoops, sneakers, and late-night ranked queues — the kind where your whole day swings on one promo match. I built this platform for people like us: the grinders, the ones who show up every day, and rarely get anything back for it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT GG LOOP LLC IS (SIMPLE + HONEST)

A gaming rewards platform where your community earns real value for playing the games they already love — League, Valorant, TFT.

No crypto.
No gimmicks.
No dark patterns.
Just Play → Earn → Loop.

And it's completely free to try — no commitment, no credit card, no pressure.
If your viewers don't vibe with it, that's totally fine.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY I'M REACHING OUT

I'm looking for creators who care about their communities and want to help shape something meaningful from the ground floor. GG LOOP LLC is early, but the mission is clear, the vision is big, and I want to build it alongside people who resonate with that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHERE WE'RE AT (FULL TRANSPARENCY)

WE ARE:
✓ Live and functional
✓ Small but growing
✓ Completely self-funded
✓ Community-first
✓ Culture-rooted (sneakers, hoops, identity, gaming)

WE ARE NOT (YET):
× A polished corporate machine
× Ready to offer heavy commissions
× Fully stocked with every reward
× At full fulfillment capacity

Honesty matters more to me than pretending we're bigger than we are.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY GETS RIGHT NOW

• Earn points for playing ranked
• Redeem for starter rewards (gift cards, gamer gear, subs)
• Culture-driven experience that actually feels like home
• A platform built with transparency, respect, and no exploitation

⭐ PLUS: FOUNDING 1000 PERKS

The first 1,000 players who join receive:
• Permanent Founder Badge
• Locked-in pricing forever
• Early access to every future feature
• Priority on new rewards and expansions

Your community gets to be early — truly early.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHERE WE'RE HEADED (THE LONG-TERM VISION)

As we grow and funding increases, GG LOOP LLC aims to support gamers with real-world needs too, including:

• Groceries
• Healthcare assistance
• Mental health resources
• Eventually even housing support
• Community uplift beyond gaming

The dream is simple:
Gaming shouldn't drain you — it should support you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT PARTNERING LOOKS LIKE TODAY

Because we're early-stage and self-funded, this is the real deal:

• Custom referral code for your community
• A dedicated creator page
• Bonus points for your viewers
• Direct access to me — no bots

As GG LOOP LLC grows, payout programs and commissions will return in sustainable form. I'm not promising anything today that I can't deliver.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF THIS RESONATES

Just reply "interested" and I'll send a simple one-pager.

No pressure.
Try it for free.
If it helps your community, amazing.
If not, all love.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
