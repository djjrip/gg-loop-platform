## 💡 IDEAS TO GET SEED PRODUCTION REWARDS GOING

### **Option 1: Automated Script (RECOMMENDED)**
**What I Built:**
- `scripts/auto-seed-rewards.mjs`
- Tries Railway CLI, environment variables, .env file
- Fully automated, no manual steps

**Run It:**
```powershell
npm run seed:production
```

---

### **Option 2: Railway CLI (EASIEST)**
**If you have Railway CLI installed:**
```powershell
railway run npm run seed:rewards
```

**One command, done.**

---

### **Option 3: Manual (BACKUP)**
**If automation fails:**
1. Get DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard
2. Run: `$env:DATABASE_URL="..."; npm run seed:rewards`

---

### **Option 4: Add to Railway Deploy (BEST)**
**Add to Railway startup:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "startCommand": "npm run db:push && npm run seed:rewards && npm start"
}
```

**Rewards seed automatically on every deploy!**
