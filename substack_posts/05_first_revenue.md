Most gaming platforms hide their metrics. Revenue, users, failures—all kept secret.

I'm doing the opposite.

Here's our Month 1 revenue breakdown: **$287** from **47 users** with a **12% conversion rate**.

Not impressive yet. But here's what we learned.

## What Worked

### 1. Discord Community Drove Quality Users

**Data:**
- Discord: 18% conversion rate
- Twitter: 10% conversion rate
- TikTok: 6% conversion rate

**Why:**
- Discord users are more engaged
- Community builds trust
- Word-of-mouth is powerful

**Lesson:** Community > Ads. Focus on Discord.

---

### 2. Pro Tier ($9.99) Had Best Conversion

**Data:**
- Bronze ($4.99): 18 users
- Pro ($9.99): 12 users
- Elite ($19.99): 3 users

**Why:**
- Pro tier offers best value (monthly points + perks)
- Bronze feels "cheap" (not enough value)
- Elite is too expensive for early adopters

**Lesson:** Mid-tier pricing wins. Optimize Pro tier benefits.

---

### 3. Manual Fulfillment Built Trust

**Feedback from users:**
- "I was skeptical, but you actually delivered the hoodie"
- "No scam, real rewards"
- "Slow but legit"

**Why it works:**
- No automation = no bots = no scams
- Personal touch builds loyalty
- Transparency about timelines (7-14 days)

**Lesson:** Manual fulfillment is slow but builds credibility.

---

### 4. Transparent Pricing (No Hidden Fees)

**What we did:**
- Show exact points needed for each reward
- No surprise charges
- Clear redemption process

**Result:**
- Higher trust
- Lower support tickets
- Better conversion

**Lesson:** Transparency > tricks.

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. TikTok Traffic Had Low Conversion

**Data:**
- TikTok: 9 users, 6% conversion rate
- Discord: 20 users, 18% conversion rate

**Why:**
- TikTok users are browsing, not buying
- Short attention span
- Need more touchpoints to convert

**Lesson:** TikTok is top-of-funnel. Use it to drive to Discord, not direct sign-ups.

---

### 2. Elite Tier ($19.99) Too Expensive

**Data:**
- Only 3 users subscribed to Elite
- Most chose Pro ($9.99) instead

**Why:**
- Early adopters are price-sensitive
- Not enough perceived value at $19.99
- Need to add more Elite-tier perks

**Lesson:** Lower Elite tier price to $14.99 or add more value.

---

### 3. Redemption Rate Lower Than Expected

**Data:**
- Redemption rate: 23%
- Target: 40%

**Why:**
- Users are saving points for bigger rewards
- Not enough low-point rewards (under 1,000 pts)
- Redemption process could be simpler

**Lesson:** Add more low-point rewards. Simplify redemption flow.

---

### 4. Onboarding Flow Too Complex

**Data:**
- 3-step onboarding (sign up → connect accounts → verify)
- 34% bounce rate

**Why:**
- Too many steps = friction
- Users drop off at "connect accounts"
- Need to simplify

**Lesson:** Reduce onboarding to 1 step. Defer account connection.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Community > Ads
Discord outperformed paid traffic. Focus on community building.

### 2. Mid-Tier Pricing Wins
Pro tier ($9.99) had best conversion. Optimize this tier.

### 3. Trust Takes Time
Manual fulfillment is slow but builds credibility. Don't rush automation.

### 4. Simplify Onboarding
Every extra step kills conversion. Reduce friction.

### 5. Transparency Builds Trust
Sharing real numbers attracts the right users (honest, engaged, loyal).
