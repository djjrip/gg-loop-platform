# Hardstuck Plat → Diamond: What Actually Works

You're hardstuck Plat 3. You've watched every YouTube guide, practiced your aim for hours, and still can't break through.

The problem isn't your mechanics. It's your fundamentals.

Here's what actually got me from Plat 3 to Diamond 2 in two weeks (no aim trainer required).

---

## The Problem

Most Plat players focus on the wrong things:
- ❌ Grinding aim trainers for hours
- ❌ Copying pro plays without understanding why
- ❌ Blaming teammates instead of fixing their own mistakes
- ❌ Ignoring positioning, economy, comms

**The truth:** You're not hardstuck because of your aim. You're hardstuck because of your fundamentals.

## What Actually Works

### 1. Fix Your Crosshair Placement (Not Aim Training)

**The Problem:**  
Plat players aim at the ground. Diamond players pre-aim head level.

**The Fix:**
- Keep crosshair at head level (always)
- Pre-aim common angles (learn the map)
- Practice in custom games, not deathmatch

**How to Practice:**
1. Load into a custom game (no bots)
2. Walk through the map
3. Keep crosshair at head level the entire time
4. Pre-aim every corner, every angle
5. Do this for 10 minutes before ranked

**Result:** You'll win more duels without "better aim."

### 2. Learn One Agent, Master It

**The Problem:**  
Plat players flex too much. They play 10 agents at a mediocre level instead of 1 agent at a high level.

**The Fix:**
- Pick ONE agent
- Play 100 games on that agent
- Learn every lineup, every trick, every matchup

**Why This Works:**
- You stop thinking about abilities
- You focus on fundamentals (positioning, crosshair, comms)
- You understand your role deeply

**My Pick:** Omen (controller, always needed, high impact)

**Your Pick:** Whatever you enjoy playing. Just pick ONE.

### 3. Economy Management

**The Problem:**  
Plat players force buy when they shouldn't. They don't coordinate with the team.

**The Fix:**
- **Full buy or save.** No half-buys.
- **Coordinate with team.** If 3 people are saving, you save too.
- **Don't force after losing pistol.** Save round 2, full buy round 3.

**Economy Rules:**
- Lost pistol? Save round 2.
- Lost 2 rounds in a row? Full save.
- Won a round? Full buy next round.
- Don't force unless it's match point.

**Result:** You'll have better guns more often. Better guns = more wins.

---

### 4. Comms That Matter

**The Problem:**  
Plat players either don't comm or comm too much (useless info, tilting, blaming).

**The Fix:**
- **Callouts only.** "One A site, low." That's it.
- **No tilting.** If you're tilting, mute yourself.
- **Mute toxic players instantly.** Don't argue. Just mute.

**Good Comms:**
- "One A site, low"
- "Sage wall down"
- "Rotating B"

**Bad Comms:**
- "Why didn't you trade me?"
- "This team is trash"
- "GG go next"

**Result:** Less tilt, better teamwork, more wins.

### 5. VOD Review (10 Minutes/Day)

**The Problem:**  
Plat players don't review their games. They repeat the same mistakes.

**The Fix:**
- Record one game per day (use Medal.tv or Outplayed)
- Watch your deaths (skip the rest)
- Identify patterns (dying to same angle, bad positioning, etc.)
- Fix ONE mistake at a time

**What to Look For:**
- Where did you die?
- Why did you die? (bad positioning, bad crosshair, bad timing)
- How can you avoid this next time?

**Result:** You stop repeating mistakes. You improve faster.

---

## The Mindset Shift

**Plat Mindset:**
- "My teammates are trash"
- "I'm unlucky"
- "I deserve Diamond"

**Diamond Mindset:**
- "What could I have done better?"
- "I'm improving every game"
- "I'll earn Diamond"

**The Hoops Grind = Ranked Grind**

I played varsity basketball in high school. Same mentality:
- **Fundamentals > flashy plays**
- **Consistency > talent**
- **Team-first > ego**

You don't make varsity by practicing dunks. You make it by mastering free throws.

Same in ranked. Master the fundamentals. The rank will follow.
