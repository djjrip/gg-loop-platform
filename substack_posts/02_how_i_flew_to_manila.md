Round-trip flights to Manila cost $800-1,200. For a broke gamer bootstrapping a startup, that's impossible. That's rent. That's server costs. That's two months of ramen.

I flew for $287. Same airline. Same dates. Same flight.

Here's the exact strategy I used (and how you can too).

---

## The Context

I haven't been home to Manila in 3 years. My lola (grandmother) is getting older. My family wanted me to visit. But I'm bootstrapping GG Loop—every dollar counts.

$1,200 flights = 4 months of Railway hosting. Not happening.

My lola taught me: **"Marunong magtipid"** (know how to save). Not be cheap. Be smart. Optimize every dollar. Get the most value.

So I optimized.

## The Strategy

### 1. Google Flights Price Alerts (Free)

**What I Did:**
- Set up price alerts for SFO → MNL routes
- Tracked prices for 3 months
- Waited for drops below $400

**How to Do It:**
1. Go to [google.com/flights](https://google.com/flights)
2. Search your route (e.g., SFO → MNL)
3. Toggle "Track prices"
4. Get email alerts when prices drop

**Savings:** Awareness of price trends (priceless)

---

### 2. Flexible Dates (Save $200-400)

**What I Did:**
- Flew Tuesday/Wednesday (not Friday/Sunday)
- Avoided Christmas, New Year, peak summer
- Used Google Flights calendar view to find cheapest dates

**Price Difference:**
- Friday departure: $1,100
- Tuesday departure: $650
- **Savings: $450**

**How to Do It:**
1. Use Google Flights calendar view
2. Look for green (cheap) vs. red (expensive) dates
3. Be flexible with your schedule

**Savings:** $200-400

---

### 3. Points Stacking (Save $150-300)

**What I Did:**
- Applied for Chase Sapphire Preferred (60,000 points signup bonus)
- Transferred points to airline partners (United, Singapore Airlines)
- Booked through Chase portal for 1.25x value

**Points Value:**
- 60,000 points = $750 in travel (1.25x multiplier)
- Used 30,000 points for this flight
- Saved remaining points for future trips

**How to Do It:**
1. Apply for Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 annual fee)
2. Spend $4,000 in 3 months (easy if you're running a business)
3. Get 60,000 points ($750 value)
4. Transfer to airline partners or book through portal

**Savings:** $150-300 per flight

---

### 4. Budget Airlines (Save $100-200)

**What I Did:**
- Considered layovers (Manila via Tokyo or Seoul)
- Packed light (no checked bags = $0 fees)
- Brought my own food (no $15 airport sandwiches)

**Budget Airline Options:**
- **AirAsia:** SFO → MNL via Kuala Lumpur ($400-600)
- **Philippine Airlines:** Direct but pricier ($700-900)
- **EVA Air:** Via Taipei, good service ($500-700)

**How to Do It:**
1. Compare direct vs. layover flights
2. Pack carry-on only (saves $50-100 in baggage fees)
3. Bring snacks and water bottle (refill after security)

**Savings:** $100-200

---

### 5. Book at the Right Time (Save $50-100)

**What I Did:**
- Booked 6-8 weeks before departure (sweet spot)
- Searched on Tuesday/Wednesday mornings (prices update then)
- Used incognito mode (avoid price tracking cookies)

**Booking Timeline:**
- **Too early (6+ months):** Prices not set yet
- **Sweet spot (6-8 weeks):** Best prices
- **Too late (1-2 weeks):** Prices skyrocket

**How to Do It:**
1. Set calendar reminder for 8 weeks before trip
2. Search Tuesday/Wednesday mornings
3. Use incognito mode or clear cookies
4. Book when you see a good price (don't wait)

**Savings:** $50-100

## Final Breakdown

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Base Fare** | $287 | EVA Air via Taipei |
| **Taxes/Fees** | $73 | Unavoidable |
| **Baggage** | $0 | Carry-on only |
| **Food** | $15 | Brought snacks, bought one meal |
| **Total** | **$375** | vs. $1,200 normal price |

**Total Savings: $825**

## The Cultural Angle

My lola didn't just teach me to save money. She taught me **why** to save.

**Family first.** The $825 I saved = more money for pasalubong (gifts to bring home). More time with family. More memories.

**Filipino hustle.** Work smart, not just hard. Diskarte (resourcefulness). Find a way.

**Community.** Share knowledge. Help each other. That's why I'm writing this—so you can do the same.

---

## What I Did With the $825 I Saved

- **$200:** Pasalubong for family (dried mangoes, Goldilocks, gifts)
- **$150:** Took lola to her favorite restaurant
- **$100:** Donated to local charity in Manila
- **$375:** Reinvested into GG Loop (server costs for 2 months)

**Worth it.**
