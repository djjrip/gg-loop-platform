## THE REAL TALK (From Architect Review)

**Persist.** Here's why:

1. **68% paid conversion is REAL** (industry avg is 5-10%)
2. **Economics aren't broken** - need validation, not redesign
3. **You've built the hard stuff** - Riot API, subscriptions, sponsor system

**Biggest risks:**
- Acquisition scalability (how to get next 1,000 users?)
- Wholesale pricing (need MOUs locked in)
- Founder burnout (you're tired NOW at 150 users...)

**6-Week Sprint Plan:**
- Replicate that 68% conversion with cold traffic
- Lock 2 wholesale suppliers at 30%+ discount
- Run 1 sponsor pilot campaign
- **If you hit these → raise seed. If you miss → take 2-week break, then decide.**

---

## 📊 IS IT WORTH IT? (Honest Answer)

**YES - but with a deadline.**

You have:
- Exceptional early traction (68% conversion)
- Working platform (100% ready to scale)
- Clear path to validate (6-week roadmap)

**The Plan:**
1. Run ONE focused 6-week sprint
2. Clear success metrics (replicate conversion OR lock sponsor)
3. If you hit metrics → full send on fundraising
4. If you miss → reassess with data, not exhaustion

**You're not "grinding forever" - you're running a deliberate experiment.**
