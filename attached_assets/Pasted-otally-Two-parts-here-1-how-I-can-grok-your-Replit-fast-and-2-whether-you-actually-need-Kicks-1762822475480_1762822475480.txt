otally. Two parts here: (1) how I can grok your Replit fast, and (2) whether you actually need Kickstarter right now.

1) How to show me what’s happening on Replit (quick + painless)

I can’t jump into your Replit directly, but if you drop a few things here, I’ll have the full picture:

Minimum bundle (15–20 min)

Preview URL (the replit.dev link) + what works vs. what’s stubbed.

Repo snapshot: paste your folder tree (top 2–3 levels) and the content of these files:

README.md (or paste one; see template below)

package.json (or pyproject.toml), vite.config, server/index.(ts|js), client/src/main.(tsx|jsx), routes/api/*

Any env vars you use (just the KEYS NAMES, not secrets) from Secrets panel.

Schema: your Drizzle/Prisma schema or DB tables (even a screenshot).

Auth flow: 5-line summary of how users sign in (email/discord/RSO later).

One minute Loom/phone screen recording: click through “sign in → report win → points → rewards.”

If you want to go pro:

Logs: last 20 lines from console when you “Report Win.”

Current blockers: 3 bullets. (“Need Riot RSO,” “Points calc stub,” “Webhook for proof.”)

Roadmap: what’s left for a closed beta (see below).

Drop-in README template (paste here, I’ll tighten it):

# GG LOOP (alpha)
What it is: [1 sentence]
Who it’s for: [Valorant & LoL players]
Core loop: [Report win -> verify -> points -> redeem]
Stack: [Vite/React + Node/Express + Drizzle + Replit DB/Postgres]
Auth: [Email/Discord, RSO planned]
Endpoints:
- POST /api/report-win  (body: {game, matchId?, proofUrl?})
- GET  /api/me          (returns {points,badges})
- POST /api/redeem      (body: {rewardId})
Data:
- users(id, riotPuuid?, discordId?, points)
- matches(id,userId,game,result,proofUrl,verifiedAt)
- rewards(id,title,cost,inventory)
Status:
- Working: [X]
- Stubbed: [Y]
- Blocked: [Z]

2) Do you need Kickstarter yet?

Short answer: probably not yet. You’ll get more leverage with a tight closed beta and proof of stickiness before you ask strangers for money. But if you want to run Kickstarter, you can—just play by their rules.

Pre-Kickstarter “readiness” checklist (greenlight this, then launch):

Functional slice (narrow but real): a single game (Valorant or LoL), 1 flow only
→ Sign in → report a match → instant points → basic redeem (non-cash reward)

Verification v0: no screenshots → use one lightweight proof (manual admin verify, game API pull later, or Discord bot confirmation).

Policies live: Terms + Privacy. No collecting credentials. No gambling language. No cash-equivalent rewards.

Brand safety: text-only references to Riot IP. “Not affiliated with Riot Games.” (No logos.)

Metrics you can show: #users, #matches logged, avg points/redeems, day-7 retention (even from 25–100 testers).

Kickstarter specifics (what flies / what doesn’t)

Allowed: software/tools with a clear deliverable.

Not allowed: raffles, lotteries, or cash/gift cards as rewards. Offer digital perks, early access, cosmetics, founder badge, Discord role, leaderboard skin, merch.

Rewards tiers idea:

$10 Founder Badge (username flair + Discord role)

$25 Beta Access + 3 “Boost Tokens” (non-cash cosmetic/XP boosters)

$49 Season 1 Pass (early access + exclusive badge + profile frame)

$99 Creator Pack (creator profile flair + referral multipliers for 30 days)

$199 Guild Captain (private feedback channel + name in credits sitewide)

No equity, no gambling, no cash equivalents. Keep rewards “transformative,” not payouts.

If you don’t do Kickstarter (honestly strong move right now)

Spin up a waitlist (Replit + tiny form), run closed beta on Discord.

Use Stripe for preorders or Gumroad for “Early Access Seat.”

Launch on Product Hunt later with your metrics and a trailer.

What I can do for you next (fast)

Tighten your README from whatever you paste.

Map the closed-beta MVP (exact endpoints, DB fields, and UI states) so you can finish it in a weekend sprint.

Draft your Kickstarter page (headline, story, video script, reward tiers, risks) or a closed-beta landing page copy + TikTok script.

If you drop the pieces from section 1, I’ll stitch them into a crisp Kickstarter-ready narrative or a clean closed-beta launch pack—your call.
