I need you to add a Privacy Policy page to this GG LOOP project.

Follow the existing stack and styling.

Create a public route/page at /privacy.

Reuse the same layout/header/footer as other pages.

On that page, render the following Privacy Policy text in a readable format (headings + paragraphs).

Add a “Privacy Policy” link in the footer that points to /privacy.

Don’t break any existing routes or components.

Here is the Privacy Policy content to use:

GG LOOP – PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: [Month] [Day], 2025

GG LOOP (“we,” “us,” “our”) operates the gaming rewards platform available at ggloop.io (“Platform”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Platform. If you do not agree, please do not use GG LOOP.

1. Information We Collect

– Game-related information: in-game IDs, match data, rank or stats obtained via third-party game APIs (for example, Riot Games APIs).
– Usage data: pages visited, actions taken on the Platform, device information, IP address, and general location (city/region level).

These third parties have their own privacy policies, and your use of their services is governed by those policies.

– You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at our support email.

8. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

9. Children’s Privacy
GG LOOP is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent in your region). If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete it.

10. Changes to This Policy
