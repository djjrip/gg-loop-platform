You are helping me build my production app GG LOOP on Replit.
I need you to add a Terms of Service page and wire it into the existing site without breaking anything.

Goals

Detect what stack this project is using (plain HTML, Express, React, etc.) and follow the existing structure and styling.

Create a new page/route that is publicly accessible at:
https://<this-project-domain>/terms

If this is an Express app, create a /terms route and a corresponding view/template.

If this is a React/SPA, create a Terms page/component and a route for /terms.

If this is static HTML, add a terms.html file and make sure it’s served correctly.

Use the same global layout/header/footer as the rest of the site so it looks native to GG LOOP.

On this page, render the following GG LOOP Terms of Service content, formatted cleanly with headings, paragraphs, and spacing that’s easy to read on desktop and mobile.

Add a “Terms of Service” link in the site footer that points to /terms.

Do not remove or break any existing routes, components, or styles.

Here is the full Terms of Service content. Please insert and format this nicely on the /terms page:

GG LOOP – TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Updated: [Month] [Day], 2025

Welcome to GG LOOP (“GG LOOP,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our website, services, and features available at ggloop.io (the “Platform”).

By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use GG LOOP.

Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country) to use GG LOOP.

If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the Platform with permission from a parent or legal guardian.

You are responsible for ensuring that using GG LOOP and participating in any rewards programs is lawful in your region.

Description of the Service
GG LOOP is a gaming rewards platform that allows players of supported games (such as League of Legends and Valorant) to earn points and rewards based on verified in-game activity, such as match wins, participation in events, and other actions.

Key features may include:
– Account creation and player profiles
– Verification of in-game accounts using third-party APIs
– Points, tiers, or subscription-based access
– Rewards such as digital gift cards, gaming gear, or sponsor perks
– Community features, leaderboards, or challenges

GG LOOP is not a gambling platform and does not offer wagering, betting, or games of chance.
We may modify, add, or remove features at any time.

Accounts and Security

To use certain features, you may need to create an account on the Platform. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account.

You agree to notify us immediately at [support email] if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or appear to be fraudulent or abusive.

Subscriptions, Payments, and Billing

GG LOOP may offer free and paid tiers, including subscription plans with monthly or recurring fees.

By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable fees to your selected payment method.

All fees are displayed before purchase and, unless otherwise stated, are non-refundable.

You may cancel your subscription at any time, but cancellation will typically apply at the end of the current billing period.

We may change subscription prices or plans. Any changes will be communicated in advance and will only apply to future billing cycles.

Points, Rewards, and Limitations

Points are a virtual reward with no cash value outside of the Platform. They cannot be sold, transferred (except as explicitly allowed by us), or redeemed for cash.

Earning points may depend on: verified match results, compliance with game rules and Platform rules, subscription tier, or event participation.

We may impose caps or limits on points or rewards per user.

We reserve the right to review and reverse points or rewards if we detect fraud, abuse, account sharing, match manipulation, or other suspicious behavior.

Rewards are provided “as available” and may be subject to third-party terms (e.g., gift card issuers, shipping providers, sponsors).

Use of Third-Party Services and Game APIs

GG LOOP may integrate with third-party services (e.g., Riot Games APIs, TikTok, Discord, payment providers).

Your use of these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies.

We are not endorsed by, directly affiliated with, or officially sponsored by Riot Games, TikTok, or any other third party unless explicitly stated.

Game account verification and match data accuracy depend on these third-party services. We are not responsible for outages, inaccuracies, or changes in their systems.

Acceptable Use and Community Rules
You agree not to:
– Use GG LOOP for any unlawful, fraudulent, or abusive purpose.
– Manipulate match results, use bots, exploit bugs, or attempt to earn rewards dishonestly.
– Harass, threaten, or abuse other users, or share hateful, discriminatory, or explicit content.
– Reverse engineer, interfere with, or disrupt the Platform or its infrastructure.
– Use multiple accounts or false identities to circumvent limits or bans.
We may suspend or terminate accounts or remove rewards for violations.

You get a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for personal, non-commercial purposes.
