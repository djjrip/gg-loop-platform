REPLIT AI PROMPT — Build the Creator Tools Page

**I need you to add a new page to my website at /creator-tools (ggloop.io/creator-tools).
The site is a gaming rewards platform called GG LOOP.
I want a fully designed “Creator Tools” hub with clean sections and clickable cards.
Match the styling, color palette, components, and layout patterns already used on the site (dark theme, rose-gold accents, rounded cards, icons).

📌 REQUIREMENTS**

Create a new route /creator-tools and a corresponding page/component.

Add the page to the navbar as “Creator Tools” right after “Shop.”

Build the page with these five sections, each using the same card UI style as the homepage features:

SECTION 1 — Build Your Brand

Shopify (placeholder affiliate URL in env var SHOPIFY_AFFILIATE_URL)

jAlbum (placeholder link)

SECTION 2 — Grow as a Creator

Clip editing apps (placeholder)

Stream tools (placeholder)

SECTION 3 — Sell Your Merch

Shopify (same affiliate link)

EasyShip (placeholder link)

SECTION 4 — Monetize Your Audience

Gemini Exchange (placeholder link)

MarketXLS (placeholder link)

IPRoyal (placeholder link)

SECTION 5 — Level Up IRL

Travel brands (placeholder)

Coffee Bros (placeholder)

CBD For Life (placeholder)

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Each item should be displayed as a clickable card with:

Logo image

Short description

“Learn More” button linking to the placeholder URL

All links must be read from a config file or .env so I can update them later.

Page must be fully responsive (mobile first).

Use Tailwind or existing CSS utilities already in the project.

Keep the aesthetic consistent with the rest of ggloop.io (dark mode, rose gold #b88675 accent, soft shadows).

NAVBAR REQUIREMENT:

Add “Creator Tools” to the main nav and have it route to /creator-tools.

DELIVERABLES:

All new files (routes + components/pages)

Any updated nav/header files

Styling or component updates if needed

Code comments showing where to plug in real affiliate links

Please generate the full code for this page, following the existing file structure of the project.
If the stack uses React/Next, use JSX.
If it uses Express + template engine, match that system.

Do NOT change existing functionality — only add the new Creator Tools system.

Output the entire solution with file paths and code blocks.

Let me know if you need more information about my project structure before writing the code.
