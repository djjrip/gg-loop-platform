## What Success Looks Like in 7 Days

| Outcome | Meaning | Next Action |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 10+ members, $290+ | ✅ Demand validated | Automate flow, scale distribution |
| 5-9 members | 🟡 Weak signal | Adjust offer, test different angle |
| 0 members | ❌ Offer doesn't resonate | Pivot, no infrastructure wasted |

**Any outcome is information. Zero outcomes in 7 days = pivot immediately.**

| Create PayPal payment link | Founder (1 min) | ⏳ Next |
| Connect CTA to PayPal link | Dev (or AG) | ⏳ Next |

**Total effort: ~30 minutes of implementation.**

## What The Founder Does

1. Nothing until someone pays
2. When payment received: manually upgrade user to Premium + add 2x multiplier
3. Send Discord invite via email/DM
4. Repeat until 10 members

**All manual. All validation.**

## 🏀 BASKETBALL SUMMARY

**The Defense:** No money flow. Platform live but zero revenue. All building, no selling. The scoreboard read $0 with no path to change it.

**The Play Call:** Founding Member tier. $29 lifetime. First 50 only. Scarcity + value + low friction. One clean offer, one clear CTA, one price.

**The Shot:**
