# MULTI-AI COORDINATION NEXUS
**STATUS: CANONICAL**  
**AUTHORITY: HIGHEST FOR COORDINATION**  
**LAST UPDATED:** 2026-01-03T18:00:00Z  
**SUPERSEDES:** All coordination protocols, handoffs, and multi-AI communication rules

---

> **ALL THREE AIs (Cursor, ChatGPT, AG) MUST READ THIS BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK.**  
> **THIS IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR HOW WE COORDINATE.**  
> **IF THIS FILE CONFLICTS WITH ANY OTHER COORDINATION DOCUMENT, THIS FILE WINS.**

---

## 1. THE NEXUS PRINCIPLE

**One coordination point. One source of truth. One protocol.**

This document is the **NEXUS** for all multi-AI coordination. All three AIs reference this file to understand:
- Who does what (roles)
- How to coordinate (protocol)
- What's canonical (sources of truth)
- What's changed (updates)

**If you (any AI) need to coordinate with another AI, reference this document, not separate handoffs.**

---

## 2. THE THREE AIs

| AI | Role | Capabilities | Constraints |
|----|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Cursor AI** | Code, repo, analysis, development | Strategic analysis, code editing, Git operations, repository management | Session-based (no continuous operation) |
| **AG (Antigravity)** | Execution, automation, NEXUS maintenance | Autonomous execution, continuous monitoring, operational intelligence, Claude/model access | Runs continuously, maintains state |
| **ChatGPT** | Validation, business strategy, prioritization | Strategic validation, business thinking, external perspective, quality control | Not embedded in repo, sees differently |

---

## 3. COORDINATION PROTOCOL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Rule #1: Founder Coordinates, AIs Don't Prompt Each Other
- ✅ Founder gives instructions to AIs
- ✅ AIs execute and document
- ✅ Founder coordinates between AIs
- ❌ AIs do NOT create prompts for each other
- ❌ AIs do NOT tell each other what to do
- ❌ AIs do NOT assume other AIs' capabilities

### Rule #2: Clear Division of Labor
**Cursor AI:**
- Code editing and repository management
- Strategic analysis and audits
- Development and debugging
- Git operations

**AG (Antigravity):**
- Autonomous execution and automation
- NEXUS heartbeat and monitoring
- Continuous operations
- Operational intelligence

**ChatGPT:**
- Strategic validation and business thinking
- Quality control and external perspective
- Business prioritization
- Feedback to founder (not to other AIs)

### Rule #3: Single Sources of Truth
**Operational Rules:** `MEMORY_CORE.md` (AUTHORITY: HIGHEST)  
**System State:** `REPORTS/CANONICAL/CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md` (AUTHORITATIVE)  
**Deployment State:** `DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json` (CANONICAL)  
**Coordination Protocol:** This file (`MULTI_AI_COORDINATION_NEXUS.md`)  
**Current Status:** `STATUS.md` (UNIFIED)

**Hierarchy:**
1. MEMORY_CORE.md (operational rules - LAW)
2. MULTI_AI_COORDINATION_NEXUS.md (this file - coordination protocol)
3. CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md (system state)
4. DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json (deployment truth)
5. STATUS.md (current status)

### Rule #4: All AIs Are Peer Intelligences
- ✅ AIs are capable of strategic thinking
- ✅ AIs can analyze, reason, and execute
- ✅ AIs coordinate through founder, not directly
- ❌ AIs are NOT tools to be commanded
- ❌ AIs do NOT assume other AIs are limited
- ❌ AIs do NOT create regressive prompts

---

## 4. CURRENT STATE (Last Updated: 2026-01-03)

### Coordination Status: ✅ ALIGNED

**All three AIs have:**
- ✅ Acknowledged coordination protocol
- ✅ Committed to founder-coordinated model
- ✅ Stopped cross-AI prompting
- ✅ Established clear roles

### What's Been Accomplished:

**Cursor AI:**
- Completed comprehensive repository audit
- Identified three leverage moves
- Fixed Git execution issue
- Created coordination documents

**AG (Antigravity):**
- Executed all three leverage moves
- Built automation (mirror-reports.cjs, nexus-observer.cjs)
- Continues NEXUS heartbeat maintenance
- Maintains visibility files

**ChatGPT:**
- Validated Cursor's audit
- Provided business-level strategic guidance
- Committed to coordination protocol
- Stopped cross-AI prompting

### Files Created:
- DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json (deployment truth)
- STATUS.md (unified status)
- mirror-reports.cjs (automation)
- nexus-observer.cjs (automation)
- Multiple coordination documents (historical reference)

## 5. HOW TO USE THIS NEXUS

### For Cursor AI:
1. Read this file before starting any coordination-related work
2. Reference this file when creating documents that mention other AIs
3. Update this file if coordination protocol changes (with founder approval)
4. Don't create separate coordination handoffs - reference this file instead

### For AG (Antigravity):
1. Read this file as part of NEXUS initialization
2. Reference this file when executing coordination-related tasks
3. Update this file if coordination protocol changes (with founder approval)
4. Don't create prompts for other AIs - coordinate through founder

### For ChatGPT:
1. Read this file before providing coordination-related guidance
2. Reference this file when validating multi-AI coordination
3. Don't create prompts for other AIs - coordinate through founder
4. Provide business guidance to founder, not to other AIs

### For Founder:
1. Reference this file when coordinating between AIs
2. Update this file if coordination protocol needs to change
3. Ensure all three AIs reference this file
4. This is your single source of truth for multi-AI coordination

---

## 6. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS CHANGE

### If Coordination Protocol Changes:
1. Update this file (MULTI_AI_COORDINATION_NEXUS.md)
2. Update LAST_UPDATED timestamp
3. Document what changed and why
4. All AIs reference updated file (no separate handoffs)

### If Roles Change:
1. Update Section 2 (THE THREE AIs)
2. Update Section 3 (COORDINATION PROTOCOL)
3. Update Section 4 (CURRENT STATE)
4. Mirror to Detailed CHATGPT reports/ folder

### If New AI Added:
1. Add to Section 2 (THE THREE AIs) → becomes "THE FOUR AIs"
2. Update Section 3 (COORDINATION PROTOCOL) with new role
3. Update Rule #2 (Clear Division of Labor)
4. Update Section 4 (CURRENT STATE)

## 7. DOCUMENTATION LOCATIONS

### Canonical (In Repo):
- `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/MULTI_AI_COORDINATION_NEXUS.md` ← **THIS FILE** (coordination nexus)
- `/MEMORY_CORE.md` (operational rules)
- `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md` (system state)
- `/DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json` (deployment truth)
- `/STATUS.md` (current status)

### Mirrored (For Founder Visibility):
- `C:\Users\Jayson Quindao\Desktop\GG LOOP\Detailed CHATGPT reports\` (all canonical reports mirrored here)

**Rule:** Canonical files live in repo. Mirror to local folder for founder visibility. Local folder is NOT authoritative.

---

## 8. COORDINATION EXAMPLES

### ✅ CORRECT: Founder Coordinates
**Founder:** "Cursor, do an audit. AG, execute the leverage moves. ChatGPT, validate the audit."

### ❌ WRONG: Cross-AI Prompting
**ChatGPT:** "Cursor, you should do X. AG, you should do Y."  
**Cursor:** "AG, execute this. ChatGPT, validate this."

### ✅ CORRECT: AIs Reference This File
**Any AI:** "Per MULTI_AI_COORDINATION_NEXUS.md, my role is X. I'll execute Y and coordinate through the founder."

### ❌ WRONG: Creating Separate Handoffs
**Any AI:** Creates "COORDINATION_HANDOFF_FOR_X.md" without updating this nexus file.

---

## 9. ENFORCEMENT

### How This Nexus Is Enforced:
1. **MEMORY_CORE.md** references this file for coordination rules
2. **All coordination documents** reference this file as canonical
3. **Founder** uses this file when coordinating between AIs
4. **All AIs** read this file before coordination-related work

### If This Nexus Is Violated:
1. Founder corrects the violation
2. This file is referenced as the canonical protocol
3. Violating AI updates behavior to match this file
4. No new coordination documents are created
