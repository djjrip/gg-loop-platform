## Why This Loop

| Alternative | Why Not |
|-------------|---------|
| Monthly subscriptions | Requires retention effort; Founding Member is one-shot |
| Affiliate/sponsored rewards | Requires partnerships; time-intensive |
| Creator referrals | Requires creator network; doesn't exist yet |

**Founding Member is the fastest path to proving someone will pay.**
