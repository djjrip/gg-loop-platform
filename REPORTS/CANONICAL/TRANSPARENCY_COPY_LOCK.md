# TRANSPARENCY COPY LOCK
**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Engineer:** Cursor AI  
**Purpose:** Lock in exact disclosure copy to prevent drift

---

## FOUNDING MEMBER PAGE - EXACT COPY (LOCKED)

### "How This Works (Manual Validation Phase)" Section

**Header:**
```
How This Works (Manual Validation Phase)
```

**Body Text:**
```
During validation: Upgrades are processed manually within 24 hours of payment.

After payment: You'll receive a confirmation email. Your 2x points multiplier applies after verification.

Why manual: We're validating real demand before building automation. This ensures we build the right features.
```

**Location:** `/founding-member` page, below main offer card

**Rule:** This disclosure must never be removed or softened. It is a transparency lock.

---

### "Fair Play" Section

**Header:**
```
Fair Play
```

**Body Text:**
```
Rewards are verified. Suspicious activity is reviewed. Cheaters get removed. We're building a platform that rewards genuine skill, not exploits.
```

**Location:** `/founding-member` page, below transparency disclosure

**Rule:** This positioning must remain clear and credible. No marketing fluff.

## PAYMENT FALLBACK MESSAGE (LOCKED)

### When PayPal URL Not Configured

**Message:**
```
Payments Temporarily Offline

Payment processing is being configured. Join our Discord to get notified when payments go live, or sign up for the waitlist.
```

**Location:** `/founding-member` page, payment button area

**Rule:** Must be honest. Never say "Coming Soon" without timeline. Never hide that payments are offline.

## TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Manual Phase Must Be Disclosed**
   - Users must know upgrades are manual
   - 24-hour timeline must be stated
   - Reason (validation) must be clear

2. **No Overpromising**
   - Don't imply instant upgrades
   - Don't hide manual processing
   - Don't make it sound automated when it's not

3. **Anti-Cheat Must Be Clear**
   - Fair Play section is required
   - Must state verification and review
   - Must state consequences (cheaters removed)

4. **Payment Status Must Be Honest**
   - If PayPal not configured, say so
   - Provide alternative (Discord/waitlist)
   - Never show fake payment buttons

---

## COPY THAT MUST NEVER BE REMOVED

### Required Disclosures (Cannot Be Removed)

1. "How This Works (Manual Validation Phase)" section
2. "Fair Play" section
3. Payment status message (if not configured)

### Copy That Can Evolve (But Must Stay Honest)

- Benefit descriptions (can be refined, but must be accurate)
- Pricing display (can change, but must match actual price)
- Proof of Life counter text (can update, but must be truthful)

**Who Can Modify:**
