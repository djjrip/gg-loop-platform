**Status:** AUDIT COMPLETE  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-03T17:46:03Z

## Audit Scope

Reviewing all user-facing copy and flows for:
- Overpromising
- Misleading claims
- Missing disclosures
- Verification constraint clarity

---

## Potentially Misleading Copy

### 1. "Get Paid to Play" Messaging

| Current | Problem | Proposed Replacement |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| "Earn rewards for playing" | Implies automatic rewards | "Earn points toward rewards by playing verified matches" |
| "Get paid to play games" | Implies cash | "Turn your gameplay into points, then into rewards" |

### 2. Points vs Real Rewards Clarity

| Current | Problem | Proposed Replacement |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Points shown as currency | Confusing value | Add disclaimer: "Points are not currency and have no cash value" |
| Reward redemption implied instant | May be manual | Add: "Rewards processed within 48 hours" |

### 3. Verification Constraints

| Missing Disclosure | Required Addition |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Manual verification phase | "During validation, upgrades are manual within 24 hours" |
| Match verification requirement | "Points awarded for verified gameplay only" |
| Anti-cheat review | "Unusual activity is reviewed. Fraudulent claims are removed." |

---

## Transparency Locks (NEVER REMOVE)

These statements must always be present somewhere in user-facing flows:

1. **"Points are not currency and have no cash value."**
2. **"Rewards require verified gameplay."**
3. **"During validation phase, upgrades are processed manually within 24 hours."**
4. **"Suspicious activity is reviewed. Cheaters are removed."**
5. **"GG LOOP is not affiliated with game publishers."**

## Current State Assessment

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Homepage messaging | 🟡 Needs review | "Earn rewards" could be clearer |
| Founding Member page | 🟢 Honest | Clear $29 lifetime offer |
| Points explanation | 🟡 Needs disclaimer | Add "no cash value" |
| Verification disclosure | 🔴 Missing | Need to add manual phase note |
| Anti-cheat statement | 🔴 Missing | Need Fair Play note |

---

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add manual phase disclosure** to Founding Member checkout
2. **Add "no cash value" disclaimer** to points display
3. **Add Fair Play note** to visible location
4. **Review homepage copy** for overpromising

## Authenticity Principles (From Memory Core)

Per MEMORY_CORE.md:
- Transparency over hype
- Systems over vibes
- Truth over optimism

**All copy must follow these principles.**
