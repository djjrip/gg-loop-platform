### Main Post
```
🚀 Stripe is live. Payments are real.

GG LOOP is officially accepting Founding Members.

$29 → lifetime 2x points on every game you play.
First 50 only. Then price goes to $49.

Here's what I built in 30 days:

The problem:
Gaming reward apps are either:
- Fake (points mean nothing)
- Sketchy (sell your data)
- Gated (invite only BS)

I wanted something real.
So I built it.
```

**2/6**
```
What GG LOOP does:
- Connects to games you already play
- Tracks verified gameplay
- Rewards honest effort

No surveys. No fake clicks.
Just play and earn.
```

**3/6**
```
The tech stack (for nerds):
- React + TypeScript
- Express backend
- PostgreSQL
- Stripe for payments
- Railway deployment

100% built by me + AI pair programming.
```

**4/6**
```
What Founding Members get:
✅ 2x points forever
✅ Name on the wall
✅ Early access to everything
✅ Direct line to me
✅ Vote on features

$29 once. That's it.
```

**5/6**
```
The transparency part:
- Points aren't cash (legal reality)
- Rewards require verified gameplay
- Cheaters get removed

I'd rather be honest than viral.
```

**6/6**
```
If this resonates, come build with us:

ggloop.io/founding-member

50 spots. Then the door closes.

See you on the other side 🎮

"Today we went live with real payments.

Three months ago this was just an idea.
Now it's a real company accepting real money.

GG LOOP rewards you for games you already play.
Verified gameplay. Real rewards. No BS.

[Show founding member page]

First 50 Founding Members get lifetime 2x points for $29.

I'm keeping it small on purpose.
Quality over virality.

If you're tired of fake reward apps, this is different."

## Key Messaging Guidelines

### DO Emphasize:
- ✅ "Stripe is live" (credibility signal)
- ✅ "Verified gameplay" (differentiation)
- ✅ "$29 lifetime" (urgency + value)
- ✅ "First 50 only" (scarcity)
- ✅ "Built by me + AI" (build in public)

### DON'T Say:
- ❌ "Make money playing games" (compliance issue)
- ❌ "Guaranteed rewards" (never guarantee)
- ❌ "Get rich" or income claims
- ❌ "100% anti-cheat" (we can't promise)

### Always Include:
- Points aren't currency
- Rewards require verification
- Cheaters are removed
