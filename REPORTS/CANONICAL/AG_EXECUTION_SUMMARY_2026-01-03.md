## Objective

Eliminate all local-machine dependencies and establish a cloud-native, repo-native reporting system requiring ZERO founder execution.

## What Was Changed

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Created `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/` | ✅ Done |
| Created `/REPORTS/ARCHIVE/2026-01-03/` | ✅ Done |
| Created `CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md` | ✅ Done |
| Deprecated `copy-reports.ps1` | ✅ Done |
| Updated `MEMORY_CORE.md` with cloud-native rule | ✅ Done |
| Archived `GG_LOOP_STATE_OF_PRODUCTION.md` | ✅ Done |

---

## What Was Deprecated

| File/System | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| `copy-reports.ps1` | Founder is non-technical; no local execution |
| Local report mirroring | Replaced by repo-native `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/` |
| All local PowerShell workflows | Cloud-native mandate |

---

## What Is Now Authoritative

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md` | `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/` | Single source of truth for system state |
| `MEMORY_CORE.md` | Repo root | Institutional memory and behavior rules |
| `NEXUS_STATUS.md` | `/nexus-bot/` | Real-time NEXUS operational status |

**All other state/status files are subordinate or archived.**

---

## What The Founder Never Has To Think About Again

| Topic | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Running scripts | All deprecated; no local execution |
| Copying files to folders | Eliminated; all in repo |
| Debugging git state | AG handles autonomously |
| Re-explaining context | MEMORY_CORE.md persists everything |
| Checking "which file is right" | CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md is the answer |

## 🏀 BASKETBALL SUMMARY

**The Defense:** Confusion. Too many status files. Local scripts requiring execution. Noise masquerading as structure. The court was cluttered with conflicting sources of truth.

**The Play Call:** Consolidation and authority. One canonical hub. One authoritative state file. Deprecate everything that required the founder to run commands. Archive the noise. Raise the floor.

**The Execution:** Clean pick-and-roll. Created `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/`, established `CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md` as the single truth, deprecated local mirroring scripts, added cloud-native mandate to `MEMORY_CORE.md`, and archived legacy files.

**The Scoreboard:** Court is clear. One source of truth. Zero local dependencies. Founder never runs a command again.

**The Next Possession:** NEXUS continues autonomous distribution. Production is live. The system operates itself. Founder observes; system executes.
