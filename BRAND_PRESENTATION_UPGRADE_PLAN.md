## COPY IMPROVEMENTS (NO CODE NEEDED)

### Homepage Hero

**Current:**
```
Earn rewards for playing
```

**Improved:**
```
Join the community earning real rewards

Play games. Earn points. Redeem gear.

No crypto. No NFTs. Just real rewards for real gamers.
```

---

### About Section

**Add This:**
```
Founded by Jayson BQ

Filipino-American gamer. Former hoops player. Broke but optimizing.

I built GG LOOP because gamers grind for hours and get nothing real back. In-game rewards don't pay rent. I wanted to change that.

GG LOOP is where gaming meets basketball culture meets sneaker culture. It's for the grinders, the ranked sweats, the budget-conscious but quality-focused.

It's honest. It's real. It's for us.
```

---

### Partnerships CTA

**Add This:**
```
Brands: Partner with GG LOOP

Reach engaged gamers through our "Choose Your Sponsor" system.

30-day pilots. Zero upfront cost. Real metrics.
