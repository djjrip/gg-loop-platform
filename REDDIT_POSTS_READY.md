# REDDIT EXECUTION PLAN - POST THESE NOW

## Post #1: r/gamedev

**Title:** Built a gaming rewards platform in 6 months (solo, TypeScript/React)

**Body:**
Hey r/gamedev,

I built ggloop.io - a platform where gamers earn real rewards (gift cards, gaming gear) by playing League, Valorant, and other games.

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- Desktop app: Electron (v1.1.0)
- Deployment: Railway
- Auth: Google, Twitch, Steam

**What's live:**
- 8 rewards in shop ($10-100 gift cards + gear)
- 17+ games supported
- Desktop app tracks matches
- Points system functional
- PayPal subscription tiers

**Challenges I hit:**
- Riot API dev key resets daily (waiting on production key)
- Anti-cheat detection (solved with process verification)
- Preventing abuse (rate limiting + cooldowns)

**No crypto, no NFTs, no predatory mechanics.**

Built completely solo while working full-time. Now at ggloop.io

Open to feedback. What would you do differently?
