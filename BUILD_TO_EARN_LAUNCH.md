# 🚀 PRODUCT UPDATE: Build to Earn is LIVE

**Title:** I updated the platform. You now get paid to code.

**Body:**
```markdown
I promised I wouldn't stop building.

Yesterday, I launched this community.
Today, I updated the **GG LOOP** platform to support the "Vibe Coding" lifestyle.

**New Feature: Build to Earn**
The desktop app now detects:
- `VS Code`
- `Cursor`
- `Windsurf`

**How it works:**
1. Download the app (ggloop.io)
2. Open your IDE
3. Earn XP while you build your own projects

I'm not just saying "Vibe Coding" is a thing. I'm building utility for it. 
Stop coding for free. Start coding for loot.

**Status:** Live in v1.1.0 (Windows) via the website.

Let me know what other tools I should verify.
