## SLIDE 4: THE PROBLEM

### Slide Text

The Problem

Gamers Want More Than Just Entertainment

• They grind ranked, upgrade setups, chase wins
• But rewards are limited (in-game only)
• Real-world value is missing
• Existing platforms overpromise, underdeliver

The Gap:
No honest, culture-first rewards platform that actually delivers.
```

### Visual Direction

- Simple graphics, no clutter
- Red/yellow color scheme (problem state)

### Notes
- Keep it relatable
- Don't bash competitors directly
- Focus on gap, not negativity

Honest Rewards for Real Gamers

How It Works:
1. Players complete missions (play games, hit milestones)
2. Earn points for achievements
3. Redeem points for real rewards (gear, gift cards, cash)

Why It Works:
• Manual fulfillment (we don't overpromise)
• Community-first (Discord, TikTok, culture)
• Real value (no fake tokens, no crypto)
• Honest brand (transparent, direct, real)

```

### Visual Direction

## SLIDE 6: WHY [BRAND]

### Slide Text (CUSTOMIZE PER BRAND)

**Example: Nike**
```
Why Nike?

Perfect Alignment:
• Our community = basketball gamers (NBA 2K, hoops culture)
• They already buy Nike (sneakers, gear, apparel)
• Filipino-American demographic (strong Nike loyalty)
• Gaming + basketball crossover (LeBron, KD, etc.)

The Opportunity:
• Reward their grind with products they already want
• Access underserved demographic (Filipino-American gamers)
• Cultural amplification (TikTok, Discord, creators)
• Real-time performance data
```

**Example: Logitech G**
```
Why Logitech G?

Perfect Alignment:
• Our community = setup-upgrading gamers
• They research peripherals (mice, keyboards, headsets)
• Logitech G = go-to brand (budget to premium)
• Competitive players need quality gear

The Opportunity:
• Reward their grind with gear they're already researching
• Direct access to purchase-intent demographic
• Creator amplification (unboxing videos)
• Conversion data (setup upgrade patterns)
```

### Visual Direction
- Brand logo prominent
- Community overlap Venn diagram
- Product photos (Nike shoes, Logitech mouse, etc.)
- Data visualization (if available)

### Notes
