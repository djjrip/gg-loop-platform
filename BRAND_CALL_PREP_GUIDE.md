# BRAND CALL PREP GUIDE
**What to Say When Brands Reply**

Last Updated: December 10, 2025

## IF A BRAND REPLIES TONIGHT

**Stay Calm. You're Ready.**

You've built a real platform. You have real users. You have a real vision. Brands need gaming demographic data. This is a win-win.

## THE 20-SECOND PITCH

**If they ask: "What is GG LOOP?"**

```
GG LOOP is a gaming rewards platform where players earn real rewards for the games they already love.

Think: Grind ranked, earn points, redeem for gear.

We're 2,000+ gamers strong, growing daily. Filipino-American founder, basketball + gaming + sneaker culture. Honest brand - manual fulfillment, no crypto/NFT nonsense.

We help brands reach engaged gamers through a "Choose Your Sponsor" system - players pick a brand when they sign up, like NIL deals for gamers.
```

## YOUR STORY (60 SECONDS)

**If they ask: "Tell me about yourself"**

```
I'm Jayson. Filipino-American, grew up playing hoops, got into gaming hard.

I saw a gap: gamers grind for hours but get nothing real back. In-game rewards are cool, but they don't pay rent. I wanted to build something that rewards the grind with real-world value.

GG LOOP started as a side project - manual Discord bot, Google Sheets tracking, me fulfilling rewards myself. It worked. People loved it. So I built it into a real platform.

Now we're 2,000+ users, growing daily. Still manual fulfillment (keeps it honest), still community-first (Discord is our heart), still real rewards (no fake tokens).

I see brands like [Brand] crushing it in gaming. I think there's a partnership here. That's why I reached out.

## FRAMING THE PILOT PARTNERSHIP

**If they ask: "What are you proposing?"**

```
A low-lift 30-day pilot.

Here's how it works:
1. We integrate [Brand] rewards into GG LOOP
2. Players complete missions (play games, hit milestones)
3. Top performers earn [Brand] rewards (gift cards, products, etc.)
4. We track everything (engagement, redemptions, conversions, social reach)
5. After 30 days, we review metrics together and decide: continue or pause

What you provide:
• Rewards (gift cards, products, credits - whatever makes sense)

What we provide:
• Platform integration
• Mission design
• Community activation (Discord, TikTok)
• Full metrics tracking
• Manual fulfillment (we handle logistics)

What you get:
• Access to engaged gaming demographic
• Real-time performance data
• Cultural amplification (our community is loud)
• Zero upfront cost - pilot basis only

If it works, we scale. If it doesn't, no harm done.
```

## TALKING ABOUT GG LOOP'S CULTURAL LANE

**If they ask: "What makes GG LOOP different?"**

```
We're not trying to be the next Twitch or Discord. We're not a crypto platform. We're not an esports org.

We're a cultural platform at the intersection of:
• Gaming (competitive grind, ranked sweats, setup upgrades)
• Basketball (hoops culture, NBA 2K, competitive mentality)
• Sneakers (streetwear, Filipino drip, style + function)
• Filipino-American identity (underserved market, strong brand loyalty)

Our community isn't just "gamers." They're:
• NBA 2K grinders who rock Nikes
• Valorant sweats upgrading Logitech setups
• Budget-conscious but quality-focused
• Cultural, loud, authentic

That's our lane. That's why brands like [Brand] fit.
```

## ANSWERING COMMON QUESTIONS

### "What's your traction?"

```
2,000+ active users, growing daily.

We're not massive yet, but we're real. Manual fulfillment means every user is engaged (no bots, no fake accounts).

Our Discord is active (daily conversations, community challenges).
Our TikTok is growing (gaming content, setup tours, reward unboxings).

We're early, but we're building something real. That's why this is a pilot - let's test, learn, and scale together.
```

---

### "Why should we work with you?"

```
Three reasons:

1. **Access to engaged gamers:** Our users aren't passive. They're grinding ranked, upgrading setups, actively seeking rewards. That's purchase-intent demographic.

2. **Cultural authenticity:** We're not a corporate platform. We're a Filipino-American founder building for a community that looks like him. That's rare. That's valuable.

3. **Low-risk, high-insight:** This is a 30-day pilot. Zero upfront cost. You get real data on gaming demographic engagement. If it works, we scale. If it doesn't, you learned something.

You're not betting the farm. You're testing a hypothesis.
```

---

### "What is the brand exposure model?"

```
We're building a "Choose Your Sponsor" system - when players sign up, they pick a brand sponsor (like NIL deals for college athletes).

They become "[Brand] Rookies," earn brand-specific points, unlock exclusive [Brand] rewards, and rep your colors on their profile.

It's player identity meets brand loyalty. NBA free agency for gamers.

For you, that means:
• Exclusive cohort (your sponsored players)
• Brand-specific missions (only your players see them)
• Profile customization (your colors, your badge, your identity)
• Discord channels (your community within our community)
• Leaderboards (your players vs other brands' players)

It's not just "we show your logo." It's "players choose to rep your brand."

That's deeper engagement. That's real loyalty.
```

---

### "How do you make money?"

```
Three revenue streams:

1. **Subscriptions:** Bronze ($4.99), Pro ($9.99), Elite ($19.99) - monthly points + exclusive rewards
2. **Brand partnerships:** You pay for rewards, we handle fulfillment + platform integration
3. **Affiliate revenue:** Impact.com partnerships (gaming gear, travel, money tools)

We're not dependent on one stream. We're diversified.

Brand partnerships are win-win: you get demographic data, we get revenue, players get rewards.
```

---

### "What if the pilot doesn't work?"

```
Then we learned something.

Maybe the rewards weren't right. Maybe the missions weren't engaging. Maybe the timing was off.

We review the data together, figure out what didn't work, and decide:
• Adjust and retry (different rewards, different missions)
• Pause and revisit later (when we hit X milestone)
• Move on (not a fit, no hard feelings)

This is a pilot. It's designed to test, not to commit.

Worst case: you spent 30 days testing a hypothesis and got real data. That's not a loss.
```

## CLOSING THE CALL

**If they're interested:**
```
Awesome. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send over a pilot concept doc (missions, rewards, metrics)
2. You review internally and give feedback
3. We finalize terms (what rewards, how many, timeline)
4. We launch Week 1 (announce to community, activate missions)
5. We track everything and review after 30 days

Sound good?

When should I send the doc? And who else on your team should I loop in?
```

**If they're unsure:**
```
No worries. I get it - you need to think about it.

Here's what I'll do: I'll send over a one-pager with the pilot concept. You can review it internally and let me know if you want to move forward.

No pressure. If it's not a fit, no hard feelings.

When should I follow up?
```

**If they're not interested:**
```
Totally understand. Appreciate you taking the time to chat.

If anything changes down the line, feel free to reach out.

Good luck with everything you're building.
```
