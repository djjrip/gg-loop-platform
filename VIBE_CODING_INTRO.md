# The r/VibeCoding Launch Post

**Title:**
r/gamedev removed my story. So I built this place. We Vibe Code here.

**Body:**
I filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September. 
I spent the last 90 days building a gaming rewards platform (GG LOOP) from scratch using AI agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.).
I have 5 users. $0 revenue. 

But I shipped. The code works. The platform is live.

I tried to share my honest "Day 90" update on other dev subreddits. 
Got removed for "self-promotion" or told that using AI isn't "real coding."

**Screw that.**

I created r/BuildYourVibe for the rest of us.

**The Manifesto:**
1. **Ship Fast:** It doesn't matter how you wrote the code. It matters that it works.
2. **Real Numbers:** Share your 5 users. Share your $0 MRR. We celebrate the grind, not just the exit.
3. **No Gatekeeping:** If you built it with prompts, you built it. Welcome home.
4. **Vibe Check:** We help each other win.

If you're building cool shit with AI and actually shipping—post it here.
I don't care if you don't know how to invert a binary tree on a whiteboard.
I care if you can build a product that people use.

My build: ggloop.io
My stack: React, Electron, Postgres, Railway, and a lot of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Show me what you're working on.
