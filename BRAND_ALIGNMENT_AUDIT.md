# BRAND ALIGNMENT AUDIT
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Scope:** Platform-wide Content Check

## 1. COMPLETED ACTIONS
*   [x] **Homepage Audit:** Identified generic copy. Created `HOMEPAGE_NEW_COPY.md` to align with "Choose Your Sponsor".
*   [x] **Roadmap Audit:** Identified technical jargon and AWS references. Created `ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md` (3-Phase Honest Version).
*   [x] **Partners Page Audit:** Identified generic form. Created `PARTNERS_PAGE_COPY.md` to sell the "NIL" model.
*   [x] **Internal Doc Scan:** Verified removal of "2,000+" fake metrics from key files.

## 2. KEY DISCREPANCIES FIXED
*   **Old Promise:** "Automated Riot Verification" -> **New Honest Promise:** "Verified Gameplay" (allows for manual/hybrid verification without lying).
*   **Old Promise:** "Earn Cash" (vague) -> **New Honest Promise:** "Earn points for gift cards and payouts" (specific).
*   **Old Tone:** "We are a massive platform" -> **New Tone:** "We are an early-stage community built for culture."

## 3. NEXT STEPS (REQUIRES DEPLOY)
1.  Apply `HOMEPAGE_NEW_COPY.md` to `Home.tsx`.
2.  Apply `PARTNERS_PAGE_COPY.md` to `Partners.tsx`.
3.  Replace `Roadmap.tsx` content with `ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md` concepts.
4.  Remove `AWSRoadmap` route from `App.tsx`.
