## Cold Email Template #1: Early-Stage Fintech Founders

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure review (from ex-NCR ops)

Hi [Name],

Congrats on [recent milestone/funding]. Building payments is hard.

I spent 2 years at NCR Atleos managing multi-million dollar transaction flows. I've seen what breaks.

Common issues I help fintech founders solve:
- Payment reconciliation (manual vs automated)
- Settlement timing optimization
- Transaction failure handling
- Compliance audit preparation

**Offer:** 1-hour payment architecture review - $250. If there's nothing to fix, I refund it.

Interested?

## Cold Email Template #2: SaaS Companies Adding Payments

**Subject:** Adding payments? Don't make these 3 mistakes

[First Name],

Saw you're hiring for payment integration work. Before you build:

**3 mistakes I see SaaS companies make:**
1. Not planning for reconciliation from day 1
2. Treating refunds as an afterthought
3. Ignoring transaction failure patterns

I help SaaS companies set up payment infrastructure correctly the first time.

**Background:** 2 years at NCR processing multi-million dollar flows. Built payment systems for my own SaaS (ggloop.io).

**What I deliver:**
- Payment architecture document
- Reconciliation workflow
- Error handling strategy
- Compliance checklist

**Investment:** $3k-5k depending on complexity.

Want to see a sample architecture doc?

Best,
Jayson

## LinkedIn Post Template #1

After managing millions in transaction flows at NCR Atleos, I learned 3 things about payments that most developers don't know:

1. **Reconciliation is harder than integration** 
   90% of payment bugs happen during settlement, not checkout.

2. **Failed transactions tell you everything**
   Your error logs are your early warning system.

3. **Compliance isn't optional**
   One audit can cost 6 months of engineering time.

Now helping fintech founders get payments right the first time.

## LinkedIn Post Template #2

Real talk from 2 years in financial ops:

Your payment system will fail. Not if. When.

At NCR, I processed multi-million dollar transaction flows. Here's what I learned:

**What breaks:**
- Payment processor went down (twice)
- Bank settlement delayed (monthly)  
- Transaction stuck in limbo (weekly)
- Reconciliation mismatch (daily)

**What saves you:**
- Automated retry logic
- Real-time monitoring
- Solid reconciliation process
- Clear escalation paths

Building a fintech? Let's talk about what to prepare for BEFORE it breaks.

## Objection Handling

**"We already have a payment processor"**
→ "Exactly. Integration is easy. Reconciliation, compliance, and error handling is where teams struggle. That's what I help with."

**"Our engineers can handle it"**
→ "Totally. Your engineers are great at building product. But have they managed multi-million dollar transaction reconciliation before? I have. For 2 years. At NCR."

**"Too expensive"**
→ "One failed audit costs $50k+ in engineering time. One reconciliation bug can lose customer trust forever. This is insurance."

**"We'll figure it out as we go"**
→ "That's what my last client said. They came to me after 3 months of manual reconciliation eating 20 hours/week. Cost them $15k in ops time. My solution cost $5k."
