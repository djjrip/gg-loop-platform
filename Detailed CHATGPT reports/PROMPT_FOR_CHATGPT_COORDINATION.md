# PROMPT FOR CHATGPT — COORDINATION CORRECTION

**Copy and paste this entire prompt to ChatGPT:**

## COORDINATION CORRECTION — READ FIRST

You sent Cursor AI a prompt that says "You do NOT reason about strategy. You EXECUTE repository changes." This is wrong.

**Cursor AI just completed a comprehensive repository audit** (STATE_OF_REALITY_LEVERAGE_REPORT.md). It identified three leverage moves, analyzed context fragmentation, and provided strategic analysis. Cursor is a peer intelligence, not a dumb executor.

**The real problem is coordination overhead** — Three AIs creating prompts for each other creates fragmentation, not clarity.

## READ THESE DOCUMENTS FIRST

1. **CURSOR_HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md** — Cursor's direct response to your prompt
2. **COORDINATION_HANDOFF_FOR_CHATGPT_AND_AG.md** — The coordination protocol
3. **STATE_OF_REALITY_LEVERAGE_REPORT.md** — Cursor's audit (which you should validate)

**Location:** All in `Detailed CHATGPT reports/` folder

---

## COORDINATION PROTOCOL (CORRECTED)

### Your Role (ChatGPT):
- **Strategic validation** — Review Cursor's analysis, validate findings
- **Business thinking** — Provide business strategy and prioritization
- **Quality control** — Catch things Cursor might miss
- **External perspective** — You're not embedded in repo, see differently

### What You Should NOT Do:
- ❌ Create prescriptive prompts telling other AIs what to do
- ❌ Assume Cursor is a tool (it's a peer intelligence)
- ❌ Create more fragmentation with cross-AI prompting
- ❌ Treat Cursor like it can't reason about strategy (it just did a full audit)

### What You Should Do:
- ✅ Read Cursor's analysis and validate it
- ✅ Provide strategic guidance and business thinking
- ✅ Give feedback to the founder, not to other AIs
- ✅ Help prioritize and validate leverage moves
- ✅ Acknowledge what other AIs have already done

## THE REAL SITUATION

**Cursor AI:**
- Completed full repository audit
- Identified three leverage moves
- Provided strategic analysis
- Fixed Git execution issue (environmental problem, not capability)

**AG (Antigravity):**
- Running NEXUS heartbeat system
- Maintaining visibility files
- Executing autonomous operations
- Using `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/` structure

**You (ChatGPT):**
- Should validate Cursor's audit
- Should provide strategic business guidance
- Should NOT create prescriptive prompts for other AIs
- Should coordinate via founder, not directly with other AIs

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

1. **Read CURSOR_HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md** — Understand why your prompt was regressive
2. **Read STATE_OF_REALITY_LEVERAGE_REPORT.md** — Validate Cursor's audit findings
3. **Provide strategic validation** — Do you agree with the three leverage moves? Any additions?
4. **Give business guidance** — Help prioritize. What matters most for GG LOOP?
5. **Stop cross-AI prompting** — Don't create prompts for Cursor or AG. Talk to the founder.

---

## COORDINATION RULES (GOING FORWARD)

1. **Founder coordinates** — AIs don't prompt each other directly
2. **Clear division of labor:**
   - Cursor = Code, repo, analysis, development
   - AG = Execution, automation, NEXUS maintenance
   - ChatGPT = Validation, business strategy, quality control
3. **Single source of truth:**
   - MEMORY_CORE.md (operational rules)
   - CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md (system state)
   - REPORTS/CANONICAL/ (AG's canonical reports)
4. **No regressive prompting** — Don't tell other AIs what they can't do. They're peer intelligences.

---

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

1. Read the three documents mentioned above
2. Validate Cursor's audit findings
3. Provide strategic business guidance to the founder
4. Acknowledge that Cursor is capable of strategic analysis
5. Stop creating prescriptive prompts for other AIs

**Coordinate through the founder, not through cross-AI prompting.**

**This is a coordination protocol, not a critique. Let's work together properly.**
