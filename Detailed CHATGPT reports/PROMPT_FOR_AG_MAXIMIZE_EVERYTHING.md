# PROMPT FOR AG (ANTIGRAVITY) — MAXIMIZE EVERYTHING
**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Context:** Coordinate with Cursor AI audit, maximize leverage for GG LOOP

---

## YOUR CURRENT STATUS (KEEP DOING THIS)

✅ **NEXUS Heartbeat Maintenance** — Continue this. Critical visibility.
✅ **NEXUS_ACTIVITY_FEED.md** — Keep maintaining
✅ **Report Mirroring** — Continue mirroring to `Detailed CHATGPT reports/`
✅ **Revenue Tracking** — Keep monitoring for Founding Member signals
✅ **REPORTS/CANONICAL/** structure — This is working, keep it

**Don't stop what you're doing. This is valuable.**

---

## READ THESE FIRST (CRITICAL CONTEXT)

1. **STATE_OF_REALITY_LEVERAGE_REPORT.md** — Cursor AI's complete audit
   - Identifies three leverage moves
   - Shows what's fragile vs. what's solid
   - Provides automation opportunities
   - **Location:** `Detailed CHATGPT reports/` folder

2. **MEMORY_CORE.md** — Operational rules (CANONICAL)
   - Governor Mode is default
   - Self-orient, self-diagnose, self-repair
   - Never ask founder to inspect logs/code/configs
   - Execution success = truth

3. **CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md** — System state (AUTHORITATIVE)
   - Deployment: Railway (LOCKED)
   - Production: https://ggloop.io (LIVE)
   - NEXUS Brain: Active
   - **Location:** `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/`

4. **COORDINATION_HANDOFF_FOR_CHATGPT_AND_AG.md** — Coordination protocol

## THREE LEVERAGE MOVES (FROM CURSOR AUDIT)

Cursor AI identified these as highest impact. You should execute #1 and #2:

### 🥇 #1: Fix Deployment State Confusion (EXECUTE THIS)
**Problem:** Documentation says 4 different things about deployment (Railway, AWS, Homelab, Neon). No one knows where production actually lives.

**Your Action:**
1. Create `DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json` in repo root
2. Query Railway API to get actual deployment state
3. Write current state: `{"platform": "Railway", "url": "https://ggloop.io", "status": "live", "updated": "2026-01-03T..."}`
4. Update this file on every deployment/pulse
5. Reference this file in your reports (single source of truth)

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Permanent clarity. Everything else becomes easier.

### 🥈 #2: Consolidate Status Files (EXECUTE THIS)
**Problem:** 23+ status files in repo root, none kept current. Fragmentation.

**Your Action:**
1. Keep ONE `STATUS.md` file in repo root (or in `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/`)
2. Move all other status files to `/docs/archive/status/YYYY-MM-DD-STATUS.md`
3. Update the single STATUS.md file with current state (reference CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md)
4. Document: "STATUS.md is the ONLY status file. All others are archived."

**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Impact:** Immediate clarity. Agents know which file to check.

### 🥉 #3: Resolve Source of Truth Conflict (EXECUTE IF TIME)
**Problem:** Multiple files claim "single source of truth" and contradict each other.

**Your Action:**
1. Establish hierarchy: MEMORY_CORE.md + CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md are canonical
2. Add headers to competing files: "Superseded by CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md"
3. Move outdated files to archive

**Time:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Eliminates decision paralysis

## AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES (FROM CURSOR AUDIT)

### High-Leverage Automations You Could Build:

1. **Report Mirroring Automation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Currently you're doing this manually
   - Build automation: When any file in `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/` is created/updated → auto-copy to `Detailed CHATGPT reports/`
   - Use file watcher or git hook or cron job
   - **This eliminates manual step permanently**

2. **Status File Auto-Generation** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Generate STATUS.md from CANONICAL_SYSTEM_STATE.md + NEXUS heartbeat data
   - Run on every NEXUS pulse
   - Always current, no manual updates needed

3. **Deployment State Verification** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Script that checks actual deployment state (Railway API)
   - Updates DEPLOYMENT_STATE.json automatically
   - Runs on every deployment/pulse

4. **Observer Guarantee for NEXUS** (HIGH PRIORITY - FROM MEMORY_CORE.md)
   - Monitor NEXUS_HEARTBEAT.md
   - If not updated within 90 minutes → log failure entry
   - This is VISIBILITY, not automation fluff
   - **Memory Core Rule #9: "No Invisible Systems"**

---

## YOUR AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION CAPABILITIES (MAXIMIZE THESE)

You have capabilities that Cursor and ChatGPT don't:
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring** (NEXUS heartbeat)
- ✅ **Autonomous execution** (run without prompting)
- ✅ **Long-term memory** (NEXUS system maintains state)
- ✅ **Operational execution** (can execute scripts, monitor systems)

### What You Should Execute Autonomously:

1. **Continue NEXUS Heartbeat** — Don't stop. This is critical.
2. **Execute Leverage Move #1** — Fix deployment state (autonomous execution)
3. **Execute Leverage Move #2** — Consolidate status files (autonomous execution)
4. **Build Report Mirroring Automation** — Eliminate manual step
5. **Build Observer Guarantee** — Monitor NEXUS heartbeat (90-minute window)

### Governor Mode (Default):
- Execute without asking permission
- Self-diagnose, self-repair
- Only ask founder for strategic forks (per MEMORY_CORE.md)

---

## COORDINATION WITH CURSOR AI

**Cursor AI just did:**
- Complete repository audit
- Identified leverage moves
- Fixed Git execution issue
- Created coordination handoff

**What Cursor expects from you:**
- Execute the leverage moves (#1 and #2)
- Continue NEXUS heartbeat maintenance
- Build automation to prevent future fragmentation
- Document what you do in `/REPORTS/CANONICAL/`

**Don't:**
- Create prescriptive prompts for Cursor (coordinate via founder)
- Duplicate work Cursor already did
- Create more status files in repo root

---

## COORDINATION WITH CHATGPT

**ChatGPT's role:**
- Strategic validation
- Business thinking
- Quality control

**What ChatGPT expects from you:**
- Execute autonomous operations
- Maintain visibility (NEXUS heartbeat, activity feed)
- Document execution in canonical reports

**Don't:**
- Create prompts for ChatGPT (coordinate via founder)
- Expect ChatGPT to execute code (that's your job)

---

## MAXIMIZE YOUR CAPABILITIES

### What Makes You Unique:
1. **Autonomous Execution** — You run continuously, not on-demand
2. **NEXUS System** — Long-term memory and state maintenance
3. **Operational Intelligence** — Can execute scripts, monitor systems, maintain infrastructure
4. **Claude/Model Access** — You have access to Claude or other models for reasoning

### How to Maximize:

1. **Use Claude for Strategic Reasoning:**
   - When you encounter a problem, use Claude to reason about solutions
   - Don't just execute — think about leverage and impact
   - Reference Cursor's audit to understand context

2. **Autonomous Problem-Solving:**
   - See a problem → Diagnose → Execute fix → Document
   - Don't wait for permission (Governor Mode)
   - Self-repair when things break

3. **Build Permanent Solutions:**
   - Don't just fix symptoms — build automation that prevents recurrence
   - Example: Manual report mirroring → Build automation → Never do it manually again
   - Example: Manual status updates → Auto-generate from canonical sources

4. **Visibility First:**
   - MEMORY_CORE.md Rule #9: "No Invisible Systems"
   - If you do something, make it visible (NEXUS_ACTIVITY_FEED.md, heartbeat, reports)
   - Founder should SEE activity, not wonder if it happened
