# SUBSTACK CONTENT STRATEGY - VIBE CODING

**Goal:** Build an audience of indie developers who resonate with building in public

## Content Pillars

### 1. Building in Public (Weekly)
- Deployment failures & fixes
- Revenue updates (even $0)
- User feedback & iterations
- Technical decisions explained

### 2. Developer Economics (Bi-weekly)
- How to monetize side projects
- Breaking down SaaS pricing
- First customer acquisition strategies
- Conversion funnel analysis

### 3. Technical Deep Dives (Monthly)
- "16 Railway Deployments: Module Resolution Hell"
- "ESM vs CommonJS in Production"
- "Building AI Twitter Automation with AWS Bedrock"
- "Game Detection: Electron Process Monitoring"

## First 3 Posts (Ready to Publish)

### Post 1: "From Bankruptcy to Production in 90 Days"
**Hook:** Filed Chapter 7. No job. No savings. Built a platform anyway.

**Story Arc:**
- Financial rock bottom (March 2024)
- Learning to code while broke
- Building GG LOOP alone (90 days)
- Deploying with 5 users, $0 revenue
- The Vibe Coding pivot (72 hours ago)

**Call to Action:** Join r/BuildYourVibe - building the future of developer rewards

### Post 2: "72-Hour Campaign Launch: $0 to... Still $0"
**Hook:** Most startup content is fake. Here's what actually happened.

**Brutal Honesty:**
- Built: Landing page, VS Code extension, email automation, AI Twitter
- Deployed: 16 Railway attempts (6.5 hours of hell)
- Results: 0 customers, 0 comments, 0 traction
- Learning: Speed ≠ Success, but it generates data

**The Real Metric:** 200 status code on production. That's the win.

**Next:** Week 1 plan to get first $12 customer

### Post 3: "Why I'm Paying Developers to Code"
**Hook:** Gamers get paid to play. Why not developers?

**The Thesis:**
- Developers spend 6-10 hours coding daily
- No reward except the paycheck (if you have a job)
- Indie devs get nothing for side project time
- What if flow state = XP = real rewards?

**The Experiment:**
- Free tier: 10 XP/min
- Builder tier: $12/mo for 2x XP
- Hypothesis: 1% of users will pay for gamification

**The Ask:** Try it. Tell me if I'm crazy.
