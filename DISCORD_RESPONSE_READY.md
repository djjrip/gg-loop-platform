# Discord Response - Partnership Lead (Johnnym)

**Send this:**

Hey Johnnym!

Appreciate you reaching out. Always down to connect with builders in the gaming space.

**Quick context on what I'm building:**
GG LOOP - rewards platform for gamers. Desktop verification for 17+ games, real rewards (gift cards, gear), PayPal subscriptions.

Currently at 5 users, $0 revenue, building in public from bankruptcy. Real early stage but the tech works.

**What are you building?**
- What's your product?
- What stage are you at?
- What kind of collaboration were you thinking?

Down to jump on a call this week if that's easier than DMs.

## Why This Works:

1. **Honest about stage** - "5 users, $0 revenue" shows transparency
2. **Not salesy** - Asking questions, not pitching
3. **Open to collaboration** - Suggests call, doesn't demand
4. **Shows credibility** - Built real tech, not just idea
5. **Authentic** - Mentions bankruptcy (vulnerability = trust)

Send this and see what they're actually building. Could be:
- White-label opportunity
- Integration partner
- Competitor (still good to network)
- Potential acquirer (unlikely but possible)

Next steps after they respond:
1. If legit partnership → Schedule call
2. If competitor → Stay friendly, learn from them
3. If tire-kicker → Polite but move on
