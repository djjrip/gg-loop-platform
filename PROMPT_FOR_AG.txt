AG - I need you to verify and fix any unauthentic data in my codebase. This is a REAL business (GG LOOP LLC) and every number must be REAL from the database.

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use hardcoded numbers (revenue, user counts, etc.)
- ALWAYS query the database for all data
- NEVER create mock/test/example data
- If no data exists, return 0 or empty array (NOT fake data)
- ALWAYS use environment variables for sensitive data

YOUR TASKS (in order):
1. Search entire codebase for fake/mock/test data and replace with real database queries
2. Test browser automation (server/automation/browserAutomation.ts) - verify it uses env vars, not hardcoded data
3. Set up business automation cron job on Railway (server/businessAutomation.ts runs every hour)
4. Audit all reports/dashboards - verify they use real database queries

READ THESE FILES FIRST:
- AG_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md (your master guide - read this first!)
- AUTHENTICITY_GUARDRAILS.md (rules for authentic data)
- AUTHENTICITY_AUDIT.md (what Cursor already fixed)

WHAT TO CHECK:
- server/routes.ts (already fixed brand data, but verify)
- server/revenueOptimizer.ts (already fixed LTV, but verify)
- server/businessAutomation.ts (verify all queries are real)
- server/analytics.ts (check for fake metrics)
- Any dashboard/report files

HOW TO FIX:
If you see: const revenue = 1250; // ❌ WRONG
Replace with: const [revenue] = await db.select({ total: sql`SUM(amount)` }).from(pointTransactions); // ✅ CORRECT

REPORT BACK:
- What fake data you found (if any)
- What you fixed
- What's working
- What needs Cursor's help

Remember: This is a REAL business. Every number must be REAL. No fake data. No examples. 100% authentic.
