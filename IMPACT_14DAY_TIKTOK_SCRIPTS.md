## DAY 1: GearUP Booster (Gaming)

### SCRIPT
**HOOK (0-3 sec):**
"This is how I fixed my ping and climbed to Diamond"

**BODY (3-45 sec):**
[Show before/after ping stats on screen]
"So I was hardstuck Plat for like 3 months, blaming my teammates, blaming the meta, blaming everything. Then I checked my ping - 80ms. Not terrible, but not great. I tried GearUP Booster, got it down to 35ms. Suddenly I'm hitting shots I was missing before. Climbed to Diamond in 2 weeks. Was it all the ping? No. But did it help? 100%. If you're serious about ranked, your connection matters more than you think."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"Link in bio if you're tired of blaming lag. Yeah it's an affiliate link, but it actually works. Try it for a week, see if it helps."

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- **Visual:** Split screen - before (80ms) vs after (35ms)
- **Text Overlay:** "80ms → 35ms", "Plat → Diamond"
- **Music:** Upbeat gaming track
- **Length:** 45-60 seconds

## DAY 2: Alaska ATMOS (Travel)

### SCRIPT
**HOOK (0-3 sec):**
"How I flew to Manila for $287 when everyone else paid $1,200"

**BODY (3-45 sec):**
[Show booking screenshot]
"Okay so everyone's like 'flights to the Philippines are so expensive' and yeah, if you book like a normal person, you're paying $1,000-$1,500 round trip. But here's the move: Alaska miles. You buy miles when they're on sale - like 2 cents per mile - then book flights for way less. I just booked LAX to Manila for 50,000 miles, which cost me $287 total. Same flight? $1,200 if you pay cash. This is literally how I fly home every year. It's not a secret, it's just math."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"Points guide in bio. This is the exact strategy I use every time. Referral link, we both win."

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- **Visual:** Show booking screenshot, calculator overlay
- **Text Overlay:** "$1,200 → $287", "Alaska Miles Hack"
- **Music:** Chill travel vibe
- **Length:** 45-60 seconds

### POSTING DETAILS
**Vanity Link:** `alaska.gqco.net/xLWL01?subId1=tiktok&subId2=alaska_miles_szn1&subId3=20251212_day2`

## DAY 3: Shopify (Money/Business)

### SCRIPT
**HOOK (0-3 sec):**
"If I started over, this is how I'd monetize my gaming content"

**BODY (3-45 sec):**
[Show Shopify dashboard]
"So everyone's like 'how do I make money from gaming' and they think it's just streaming or YouTube. But here's the real move: merch. You don't need inventory, you don't need a warehouse, you just need Shopify + print-on-demand. Design a logo, slap it on a hoodie, sell it to your community. I'm not doing this yet, but if I was starting from zero? This is the play. Low risk, high upside, you own the brand."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"Free trial link in bio. Affiliate link, but it's legit. Try it for a month, see if it works for you."

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- **Visual:** Screen record Shopify dashboard, show example merch
- **Text Overlay:** "No Inventory Needed", "You Own The Brand"
- **Music:** Motivational business track
- **Length:** 45-60 seconds

### POSTING DETAILS

## DAY 4: DHgate (Budget Gaming)

### SCRIPT
**HOOK (0-3 sec):**
"Budget gaming setup that doesn't look budget"

**BODY (3-45 sec):**
[Show setup with DHgate accessories]
"Okay so everyone thinks you need to spend $2,000 on a gaming setup. But here's the truth: most of that money goes to branding. This mouse pad? $5 on DHgate. Same quality as the $40 Razer one. This headset stand? $8. RGB mousepad? $12. Does it perform the same? Pretty much. Does it look clean? Yeah. You just gotta know where to look. I'm not saying buy everything cheap, but accessories? DHgate is the move."

**CTA (45-60 sec):**
"Link in bio for budget builds. Affiliate link, but I actually tested these."

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- **Visual:** Show setup, zoom in on each accessory with price overlay

## DAY 5: Gemini (Money/Investing)

### SCRIPT

"Where I put my tournament winnings (not a scam)"

**BODY (3-45 sec):**
[Show Gemini app]
"So I won like $500 from a tournament and everyone's like 'spend it on a new keyboard' but I'm trying to be smarter with money now. I put $200 in Gemini - it's a crypto exchange, but it's legit, not some sketchy thing. I'm not going all-in on crypto, I'm just diversifying. $200 in crypto, $200 in index funds, $100 for fun. I'm not trying to get rich quick, I'm just trying to not be broke forever. Start small, learn as you go."
