# 🔧 QUICK FIX - Extension Icons

The extension is missing icon files. Here's the quick fix:

## ✅ SOLUTION

**The manifest has been updated to work without icons for now.**

Just reload the extension:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Ghost Bot"
3. Click the refresh icon (🔄)
4. It should load now!

---

## 🎨 ADD PROPER ICONS LATER

To add proper ghost icons later:
1. Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Save them as `icons/ghost-16.png`, `icons/ghost-48.png`, `icons/ghost-128.png`
3. Update `manifest.json` to reference them

**For now, the extension works without icons!** 👻
