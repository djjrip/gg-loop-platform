Glad you're interested! Here's what next steps look like:

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Objection: "I don't promote stuff to my audience"
**Response:**
```
Totally get it. I'm the same way - only promote what I actually use.

If you want to try GG LOOP first and see if it's a fit, I can give you early access. No pressure to promote if it's not your vibe.
```

### Objection: "What's the revenue share?"
**Response:**
```
We do [X]% of subscription revenue from your referrals. So if you refer 100 people and 10 subscribe at $10/month, you'd earn $[amount]/month.

Happy to adjust based on volume - open to discussing what works for you.
```

### Objection: "I'm already partnered with [competitor]"
**Response:**
```
No worries! We're not trying to replace anyone. GG LOOP is more about rewards for playing, not just watching streams.

If there's overlap, totally understand. If not, happy to explore a non-exclusive partnership.
