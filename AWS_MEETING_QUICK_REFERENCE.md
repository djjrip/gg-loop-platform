## 📞 QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: Who are your competitors?**
A: Discord Nitro (no gaming focus), Twitch Prime (streaming only). We're the only multi-game competitive platform.

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: Service abstraction layer + game partnerships + player data = defensible platform.

**Q: How much funding do you need?**
A: Raising $2M Series A. Using AWS credits to reduce burn during growth phase.

**Q: What happens if a game API changes?**
A: Service layer abstraction handles it. API changes contained to one game service.

**Q: How do you handle payment fraud?**
A: PayPal handles validation. We track suspicious patterns (rate limits help).
