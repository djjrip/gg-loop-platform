## Your Pitch (Use Everywhere)

**30-second version:**
"GG Loop rewards competitive gaming. Play Valorant, CS2, or League → earn points → 
redeem for Discord roles, coaching, merch, or charity donations. Open beta, free to join."

**2-minute version:**
"I built GG Loop because competitive gamers spend hundreds of hours improving their 
rank, but get nothing tangible for it. My platform tracks your performance and gives 
you real rewards - Discord roles, coaching sessions, platform merch, or charity donations.

It's like achievement unlocked, but for real life. You can see your rank, compete on 
leaderboards, and actually get something for grinding.

We're in open beta with Valorant, CS2, and League, and adding new games constantly. 
Want to check it out?"

## Next Steps

1. **This hour:** Pick your top 3 communities and make posts
2. **Today:** Get 10 friends to sign up
3. **Tomorrow:** Start posting on Twitter daily
4. **This week:** Do all Week 1 activities
5. **Next week:** Keep going, analyze what's working

**The key:** Start TODAY. Every day you wait is users you're not getting.

Good luck! 🚀
