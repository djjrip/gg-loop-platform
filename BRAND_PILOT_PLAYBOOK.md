## OBJECTION HANDLING (DURING PILOT)

### "This isn't performing as expected"
**Response:**
"Totally fair. Let's look at the data together. What specific metric are you concerned about? We can adjust mid-pilot if needed."

### "We're not seeing enough social amplification"
**Response:**
"Understood. Let me activate our creator network and push more content. Give me 48 hours to boost visibility."

### "Our legal team has concerns"
**Response:**
"No problem. What specifically are they concerned about? I'm happy to hop on a call with them to address it."

### "We want to pause the pilot early"
**Response:**
"I respect that. Can we at least finish the current week so we have clean data? Then we can decide together."

## POST-PILOT DECISION TREE

### If Pilot Succeeds (Metrics Hit Targets)
**Next Steps:**
1. Propose 90-day extension
2. Increase reward budget
3. Add more mission packs
4. Explore co-marketing opportunities

### If Pilot Underperforms (Metrics Miss Targets)
**Next Steps:**
1. Analyze why (wrong audience? wrong rewards? wrong timing?)
2. Propose adjusted pilot (different game, different rewards)
3. If no interest, thank them and move on

### If Pilot is Neutral (Some Metrics Hit, Some Miss)
**Next Steps:**
1. Identify what worked (double down)
2. Identify what didn't (cut or adjust)
3. Propose refined pilot (same brand, better execution)
