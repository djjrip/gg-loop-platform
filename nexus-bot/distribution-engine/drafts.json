    "content": "## The Problem\n\nI'm a solo founder building GG LOOP - a platform for gamers to track competitive progress.\n\nFor weeks, I shipped feature after feature:\n- Riot Games authentication\n- Desktop verification app\n- Points and rewards system\n- Subscription tiers\n\nBut zero distribution. Zero announcements. Zero users seeing any of it.\n\n## What I Realized\n\nI'm an engineer. I love building. I hate marketing.\n\nSo I kept my head down and coded. Classic indie dev trap.\n\n## What I Built Instead\n\nI created NEXUS - an autonomous operating brain that:\n\n1. **Monitors my commits** - knows when I ship something\n2. **Detects distribution gaps** - if I build for 3+ days without announcing\n3. **Blocks my workflow** - literally tells me \"STOP BUILDING. ANNOUNCE.\"\n4. **Generates content** - drafts tweets and Reddit posts from what I shipped\n\nNow the system is smarter than my own bad habits.\n\n## Current Reality\n\n- Platform is live at ggloop.io\n- All core features working\n- Desktop app built (not released yet)\n- Zero marketing spend\n- Zero users beyond beta\n\n## What Would Unlock Growth\n\n- Distribution consistency (this system should help)\n- Small marketing budget for targeted ads\n- Strategic partnerships with gaming communities\n\n## The Lesson\n\nIf you know you'll skip something, build a system that forces you to do it.\n\n---\n\n*Building in public.

    "content": "## Context\n\nI'm building GG LOOP solo. I have engineering skills but no marketing instincts.\n\n## The Architecture\n\nI created a system called NEXUS with these components:\n\n### 1. Observer Layer\n- Monitors frontend health (is site up?)\n- Monitors backend health (API responding?)\n- Monitors deployment state (when was last deploy?)\n- Monitors output (am I shipping or idle?)\n\n### 2. Decision Engine\n- Classifies state into 6 categories\n- STABLE_AND_PRODUCING (green)\n- STABLE_BUT_IDLE (yellow)\n- MISALIGNED_BUILDING_NO_DISTRIBUTION (orange)\n- BROKEN_PLATFORM (red)\n- BROKEN_OUTPUT_PIPELINE (red)\n- RISKY_DRIFT (purple)\n\n### 3. Distribution Engine\n- Detects newsworthy events (deploys, features, fixes)\n- Generates content in authentic voice\n- Posts to Twitter and Reddit automatically\n- Respects rate limits (1 tweet/day, 2 Reddit/week)\n\n### 4. Founder Desktop App\n- Visual beacon shows state at a glance\n- Executive summary in 3 sentences\n- Executive override to set priorities\n- Auto-starts, runs in system tray\n\n## Key Design Decision\n\nThe system doesn't ask me what to post. It tells me what needs to be posted based on what actually happened.\n\nI removed myself from the ideation loop because I was the bottleneck.\n\n## Current Constraint\n\nNo users yet. The system works, but I need distribution momentum.\n\n---\n\n*What systems have you built to fix your own weaknesses?*",
