# GG LOOP BRAND ONE-PAGER
**Mission:** To build the most rewarding ecosystem for competitive gamers.
**Motto:** Play. Earn. Loop.
**Founder:** Jayson BQ (Filipino-American, Former Hooper, Gamer)

## THE PROBLEM
Gamers pour thousands of hours into competitive titles (Valorant, League, Apex, 2K) and get nothing back but virtual skins and burnout. The "Path to Pro" is closed to 99.9% of players.

## THE SOLUTION: GG LOOP
GG LOOP is a rewards platform that treats **every** competitive gamer like a pro athlete.
*   **Track Stats:** We integrate with game APIs to verify performance.
*   **Earn Points:** Kills, wins, and consistency translate to GG Points.
*   **Get Rewards:** Points redeem for real gear, gift cards, and cash—not crypto tokens.

## THE CORE INNOVATION: "CHOOSE YOUR SPONSOR"
We are democratizing the sponsorship model.
*   When a user signs up, they "Sign" with a brand (e.g., Logitech, Nike, Target).
*   This isn't just an ad; it's an **Identity**.
*   They become a "Logitech Rookie" or a "Nike Athlete" within our ecosystem.
*   They earn brand-specific rewards and represent that team on the leaderboard.

## WHY BRANDS CARE
1.  **Identity > Impressions:** Users aren't just seeing an ad; they are *identifying* with the brand.
2.  **Verified Data:** We know exactly who plays what, for how long, and how good they are.
3.  **Culture:** We sit at the intersection of Gaming, Basketball, and Sneaker culture. We aren't "cringe gaming"—we are "competitive lifestyle."

## THE ASK (PILOT PROGRAM)
We are an early-stage platform looking for **Phone Booth Pilots**:
*   **Duration:** 30 Days.
*   **Scope:** Limited user group (Controlled test).
*   **Commitment:** Small reward pool (Gift cards/Products) to test the model.
*   **Goal:** Prove that "Choosing a Sponsor" drives higher retention and brand love.
