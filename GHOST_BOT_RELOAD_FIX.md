# 🔄 Ghost Bot Reload - Direct Solution

**Chrome extensions can't be auto-reloaded from outside Chrome.** Here's the fastest way:

---

## ⚡ FASTEST METHOD (5 seconds)

1. **Open Chrome** (if not already open)
2. **Click the address bar** (or press `Ctrl+L`)
3. **Type:** `chrome://extensions/`
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Find "Ghost Bot - Virtual Assistant"**
6. **Click the refresh icon** (🔄)
7. **Done!** ✅

---

## 🎯 OR USE THE BATCH FILE

**Double-click:** `RELOAD_GHOST_BOT.bat`

This should open `chrome://extensions/` for you.

---

## 📝 WHY IT'S MANUAL

Chrome's security model prevents external programs from reloading extensions automatically. This is by design - you need to click the refresh button yourself.

**This is normal!** All Chrome extension developers do this. ✅

---

## ✅ VERIFY IT WORKED

After reloading:
1. Click the Ghost Bot icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Look at the header: "Ghost Bot v1.0.2"
3. If you see v1.0.2, it worked! ✅

## 💡 PRO TIP

**Keep `chrome://extensions/` bookmarked or open in a tab!**

Then you just:
1. Make changes
2. Click refresh
3. Test

**Takes 2 seconds!** ⚡
