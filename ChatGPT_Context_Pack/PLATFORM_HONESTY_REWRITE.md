# PLATFORM HONESTY REWRITE PACK
**Objective:** Eliminate deception while maintaining excitement.

## 1. HOMEPAGE REWRITES

### HERO SECTION
*   **Current (Risky):** "Select a Brand Sponsor on Day 1."
*   **New (Honest):** "Join the Pilot. Get Matched with a Sponsor."
    *   *Why:* "Get Matched" implies a process/waitlist, "Select" implies instant gratification.

### HOW IT WORKS
*   **Current (Risky):** "Complete daily missions... keys off actual gameplay."
*   **New (Honest):** "Link your account. Pilot missions verify your stats."
    *   *Why:* Removes the promise of "Daily" (which implies 24/7 uptime) and clarifies "Pilot" missions.

## 2. EMAIL REWRITES (Outreach)

### THE "USER BASE" CLAIM
*   **Current:** "2,000+ gamers actively upgrading..."
*   **New:** "Community of 2,000+ gamers ready to upgrade..."
    *   *Why:* "Actively upgrading" implies they are currently redeeming rewards. "Ready to" implies potential.

### THE "FEATURE" CLAIM
*   **Current:** "We're building a 'Choose Your Sponsor' system - players pick a brand..."
*   **New:** "We are launching the 'Choose Your Sponsor' Pilot - ensuring players pick YOUR brand."
    *   *Why:* Keeps the excitement but frames it as a Launch Event, not a legacy feature.

## 3. DASHBOARD UX CLARIFICATIONS

### SPONSOR STATUS
*   **If No Sponsor:** "Status: Free Agent. (Pilot Launching Soon - Stay Tuned)"
*   **If Sponsored:** "Status: Contract [Active/Pending/Pilot]"

### REWARD SHOP
*   **Disclaimer:** "Rewards restocked weekly. Pilot quantities limited."
    *   *Why:* Manages expectations if we run out of inventory manually.

## 4. GENERAL VOCABULARY GUIDE
*   ❌ **Avoid:** "Automated," "Instant," "Guaranteed," "Unlimited."
*   ✅ **Use:** "Verified," "Pilot," "Exclusive," "Limited Time."
