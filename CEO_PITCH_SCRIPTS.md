# CEO PITCH SCRIPTS (AUDIO/VIDEO)

## 1. THE "ELEVATOR PITCH" (30 Seconds)
"I'm building GG LOOP. It’s the 'NIL' model for gamers.
Right now, millions of kids grind ranked matches for free.
We let them 'sign' with a sponsor—like Nike or Logitech—on our platform.
They verify their stats, earn points, and get real gear from that sponsor.
It turns passive players into brand ambassadors. We're piloting the model now."

## 2. THE "FULL PLATFORM" (60 Seconds)
"GG LOOP is a rewards ecosystem for the competitive gamer.
Think of it like a frequent flyer program, but for Valorant and League of Legends.
The core innovation is 'Choose Your Sponsor.'
Instead of just earning generic points, you sign a contract with a brand you love.
You become a 'Team Razer' or 'Team Jordan' player.
You grind daily missions, we track the API data, and you cash out for real rewards.
We're solving two problems: Gamers get burnout from zero rewards, and Brands get ignored by ad-blockers. We fix both."

## 3. THE "WHY ME" (Founder Story)
"I grew up on the basketball court and the server.
In sports, there's a clear path: High School -> College -> Pro -> Sponsorship.
In gaming, you're either Ninja, or you're nobody.
I built GG LOOP to be the middle class of esports.
I know this culture because I *am* this culture. Sneakerheads, hoopers, grinders.
We aren't building a crypto scam; we're building a digital career path."
