Hey,

Thanks for subscribing to Vibe Coding.

I'm Jayson. Filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2024. Taught myself to code. Built GG LOOP in 90 days. Deployed with 5 users and $0 revenue.

This newsletter is the unfiltered journey from $0 to (hopefully) not $0.

What you'll get:
- Weekly building updates (what shipped, what broke)
- Real revenue numbers (even when it's $0)
- Technical breakdowns (ESM vs CommonJS nightmares)
- Product decisions and pivots

No fake metrics. No growth hacking BS. Just honest building.

First post drops Monday.

- Jayson
