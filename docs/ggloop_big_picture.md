# GG LOOP: The Big Picture (Single Source of Truth)

**Date Updated:** 2025-12-19
**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT

## 1. What GG LOOP Is (LIVE TODAY)
GG LOOP is a **gaming identity and trust platform**.
We provide a unified "Gamer Profile" that aggregates your gaming activity into a verifiable reputation signal.

*   **Identity:** Connect your accounts (Riot, Steam, etc.) to prove ownership.
*   **Verification:** specific gameplay loops (like "Play 1 Game of League") content verification.
*   **Trust:** A baseline "Trust Score" (hidden or visible) that distinguishes real humans from bots/farmers.

**Current Reality:** You can create an account, verify your Riot ID, and verify basic gameplay actions. That is it.

## 2. What Is In Development (NEXT)
We are building the **Desktop Verification Layer**.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a stronger signal than web-only API checks.
*   **Mechanism:** A lightweight desktop app that confirms session validity (human presence + hardware signature) without being invasive.
*   **Goal:** To unlock higher tiers of trust, which will eventually be required for higher-value opportunities.

## 3. The Long-Term Vision (FUTURE - NOT PROMISED)
Our north star is **"Play → Earn → Loop"**.
We aim to let gaming effort translate into tangible real-world value (paying bills, buying groceries, funding a lifestyle).
*   **The Path:** Trusted Identity -> Trusted Activity -> Trusted Rewards.
*   **The Constraint:** We cannot promise this reward layer until the *TRUST* layer is impenetrable. Fraud kills reward economies. Therefore, we presume nothing and build the trust engine first.

## 4. What GG LOOP Is NOT (The Anti-Definition)
*   **NOT a "Get Rich Quick" Scheme:** We do not promise income.
*   **NOT a Gambling Site:** We are not a casino.
*   **NOT Spyware:** We do not screenshot your desktop or read your private files. We look for specific game process signals only.
*   **NOT a "Crypto Airdrop":** While we may use blockchain tech for transparency, we are not selling a token to retail speculators.
