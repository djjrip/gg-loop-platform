### Reddit Post Draft
**Subreddits:** r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/VALORANT, r/leagueoflegends

**Title:**  
"I built a platform that pays you for gaming ($5/month → earn $30-45/month in rewards)"

**Body:**
```
I'm a 24yo streamer tired of spending $100/month on gaming with zero ROI.

So I built GG Loop - earn points for match wins, redeem for gift cards.

Math: $5/month subscription → win 30 matches → 300 points → $30 in rewards = net profit while gaming.

Live at: ggloop.io

Free profile to build your gaming portfolio. Struggling streamers - this is for you.

### Twitter Thread Draft (7 tweets)

1/ I built a platform that pays gamers for playing. Here's the breakdown: 🧵

2/ Most streamers with <50 viewers are broke. I was spending $100/month on gaming. Zero return.

3/ So I built @GGLoop:
• $5/month subscription
• Earn points for match wins
• Redeem for gift cards

4/ The math:
Win 30 matches = 300 points
10 points = $1 reward value
= $30/month in rewards

Net profit: $25/month while gaming

5/ Your gaming portfolio in one link:
ggloop.io/profile/[yourname]

Show sponsors you're serious even with 8 viewers.

6/ Live now: ggloop.io
First 100 users get early access pricing.

If you're a struggling streamer, this is for you.

7/ RT if you know a gamer who needs this 🎮
