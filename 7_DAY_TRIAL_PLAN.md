- **Saved:** ~20 hours/week = **80 hours/month**

### Money Made:
- Affiliate commissions: $0.50-$4.00 per redemption

- Plus your regular revenue from subscriptions/points

### Your Daily Routine:
1. **Morning (2 min):** Check email report
2. **Midday (5 min):** Review high-value redemptions if any
