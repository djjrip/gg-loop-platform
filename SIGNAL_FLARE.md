Just got removed from r/gamedev for "self-promotion" after sharing my 90-day bankruptcy-to-shipped story.

They said using AI isn't "real coding."

So I built my own home. 

r/BuildYourVibe

No gatekeepers. 
Ship fast. 
Real metrics.

If you build with Claude/Cursor - get in here. 👇

I filed for bankruptcy 90 days ago. 
Today, my gaming platform is live with 5 users.

I tried to share the technical journey on Reddit, but got removed because "AI coding isn't real coding."

Gatekeeping kills innovation.

So I launched a new community today: r/BuildYourVibe.

It's for the builders who:
1. Ship fast
2. Don't care about "perfect code"
3. Use every tool available (AI, No-code, etc.)
4. Share real numbers

If you're tired of the purists, come build with us.

Examples of "real coding" according to Reddit: Leetcode.
Examples of "fake coding": Building a shipping product in 90 days with AI.

I choose the fake one. 

We just launched r/BuildYourVibe for AI-native builders. 
Come through if you actually ship.
