# PARTNERS PAGE SPECIFICATION
**Objective:** Convert `/partners` from a generic form to a B2B sales landing page.

## 1. HERO SECTION
*   **Headline:** "THE 'NIL' MODEL FOR GAMERS."
*   **Subhead:** "Reach the most engaged demographic in the world by becoming their sponsor, not just their advertiser."
*   **CTA:** "Inquire About Pilots"

## 2. THE PROBLEM (B2B)
*   "Gamers ignore ads. They use ad-blockers. They skip commercials."
*   "But they obsess over *sponsorships*."

## 3. THE SOLUTION (CHOOSE YOUR SPONSOR)
*   **Concept:** "On GG LOOP, users actively select your brand to represent."
*   **Benefit:** "They become 'Logitech Rookies' or 'Nike Athletes'. They grind *for* you."

## 4. PILOT PROGRAM DETIALS
*   **Header:** "The 30-Day Pilot"
*   **Bullet 1:** "Low Risk: Capped reward pools."
*   **Bullet 2:** "High Signal: Direct engagement data."
*   **Bullet 3:** "Turnkey: We handle the tracking and verification."

## 5. CONTACT FORM (EXISTING)
*   Keep the existing form but update the fields if necessary to ask for "Brand Name" and "Pilot Interest Level".
