# AI Automation Agency - Outreach Templates

## Cold Email Template #1: Local Real Estate Agents

**Subject:** Automate your lead follow-up (save 10+ hours/week)

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're running a successful real estate business in [City]. Quick question: how much time do you spend manually following up with leads?

I build AI automation systems for local businesses. For agents like you, I typically automate:
- Lead follow-up sequences (instant response to new inquiries)
- Appointment scheduling (syncs with your calendar)
- CRM updates (no more manual data entry)

**Result:** My last client saved 12 hours/week and closed 2 extra deals in the first month.

I'm taking on 2 new clients this month. 15-minute intro call to see if it's a fit?

Best,
Jayson Quindao
Founder, GG Loop LLC

P.S. No contract, just $3k setup + you keep the system forever.

## Cold Email Template #2: Business Coaches/Consultants

**Subject:** Automate your entire sales pipeline

[First Name],

I help coaches automate the boring parts of their business.

You have two options:
1. Keep manually sending follow-ups, booking calls, updating spreadsheets
2. Let AI handle it while you focus on closing

I built a system for a consultant in Dallas that:
- Responds to every inquiry within 60 seconds
- Books qualified calls automatically
- Sends nurture sequences to cold leads
- Tracks everything in one dashboard

**Cost:** $2,500 setup. **Time saved:** 8-15 hours/week.

Want to see a demo? Takes 10 minutes.

## LinkedIn DM Template #1: Warm Connection

Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [topic] - really resonated with me.

I'm building AI automation for small businesses (former NCR financial ops, now founder). Just helped a [their industry] business automate their lead follow-up.

If you ever want to chat about automation for [their business], happy to share what's working.

Cheers,
Jayson

## LinkedIn DM Template #2: Fellow Founder

[Name] - 

Love what you're building with [company]. Quick question: have you automated your [specific process] yet?

I just left NCR to build automation systems. Helped a few founders in DFW save 10+ hours/week on manual work.

No pitch, just genuinely curious what you're using for automation. Always learning from other founders.

## Discovery Call Script

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"Thanks for taking the time. I build AI automation for [their industry]. Before I share anything, I want to understand your current process. Walk me through what happens when a new lead comes in..."

**Questions to Ask:**
1. How many leads do you get per week?
2. What's your current follow-up process?
3. How long does it take to respond to a new inquiry?
4. What tasks take up most of your time?
5. What's one thing you wish happened automatically?

**The Offer:**
"Based on what you shared, I'd build you a system that:
- [Specific automation #1]
- [Specific automation #2]
- [Specific automation #3]

Setup is $[2,500-5,000], takes 1-2 weeks. You own it forever, no monthly fees unless you want ongoing support.

Make sense to move forward?"

**Objection Handling:**

*"That's expensive"*
→ "How much is 10 hours of your time worth per week? Over a year, that's 520 hours. Most clients break even in 2 months."

*"I'll think about it"*
→ "Totally fair. What specific questions can I answer to help you decide?"

*"Can you do a trial first?"*
→ "I can show you a demo of exactly what I'd build. Would Thursday work?"
