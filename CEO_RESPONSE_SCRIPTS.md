## SCENARIO 2: MAYBE ("Send More Info")
**When they say:** "Send us some materials and we'll keep it on file."
**You Reply:**
"Understood. I've attached a one-pager outlining how the 'NIL for Gamers' pilot works.
We're moving fast with our initial launch partners, but I'd love to keep [Brand] in the loop for Q2 if the timing is better then.

## SCENARIO 4: THE "WHO ARE YOU?" (Vet Check)
**When they say:** "How big is the platform? Who is behind this?"
**You Reply:**
"We're an early-stage platform, currently in a private beta phase with a growing community of competitive players.
I'm a solo founder—Filipino-American, former basketball player, and lifelong gamer. I'm building this to solve the exact problem I faced: grinding games for zero return.
We aren't VC-bloated; we're culture-first and efficiency-focused.
Happy to share our current engagement metrics on a call."
