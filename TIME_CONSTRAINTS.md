# ⏰ GG Loop Platform - Time Constraints & Deadlines

## 🚨 Critical Deadlines

### Grafana Cloud Trial
- **Expiration Date:** December 18, 2025
- **Status:** Free/uncapped usage until deadline
- **Action Required:** Decide before this date:
  - Option 1: Upgrade to paid Grafana Cloud plan
  - Option 2: Continue using self-hosted Grafana (currently running on Docker)
  - Option 3: Migrate dashboards to alternative solution

**Current Setup:** You're running a local Docker-based Grafana instance (localhost:3030) which is FREE and has no time constraints. The December 18, 2025 deadline only applies if you're using Grafana Cloud.

## 📝 Notes

**Recorded:** December 4, 2025 at 10:54 PM CST

**Recommendation:** Since you already have a fully functional self-hosted monitoring stack running locally, you may not need Grafana Cloud at all. Your current Docker setup is:
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ No time constraints
- ✅ Fully functional
- ✅ Already configured and running

## 🎯 Action Items Before December 18, 2025

- [ ] Review Grafana Cloud features vs self-hosted
- [ ] Evaluate if cloud features are needed
- [ ] Export any existing cloud dashboards (if applicable)
- [ ] Make decision: upgrade cloud OR continue self-hosted
