# 🎯 ZERO-WORK MARKETING STRATEGY

**Core Truth:** Reddit bans self-promo. So we don't do Reddit.

## WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (100% Autonomous)

### 1. Twitter/X Organic Growth (FREE)
**Strategy:** Share your REAL story, not ads

**Auto-Posts (via Buffer):**
- Week 1: "Filipino-American gamer built this..."
- Week 2: "Anti-crypto, anti-exploitation..."
- Week 3: "Community-first gaming rewards..."

**Why it works:**
- Sounds human (because it IS your story)
- Twitter algorithm loves personal stories
- Gamers retweet authentic content

**Setup:** 5 minutes (Buffer + auto-schedule 30 posts)

### 2. TikTok Faceless Content (FREE)
**Strategy:** Screen recordings + voiceover

**Auto-Create Videos:**
- "POV: Your gaming finally pays you"
- "How a Filipino gamer built an anti-exploitation platform"
- "Turn ranked grind into real rewards"

**Why it works:**
- 10M+ gaming audience on TikTok
- Faceless = scalable
- Algorithm pushes authentic content

**Setup:** None yet, but I can build auto-TikTok bot

### 3. Discord Organic (FREE)
**Strategy:** Add value FIRST, mention second

**Auto-Messages (via webhooks):**
- "Free resource for League/Valorant grinders"
- Share your founder story
- Never spam, always give value

**Why it works:**
- Gaming communities LOVE supporting indie devs
- Filipino representation matters
- Authentic = not banned

**Setup:** Already built ✅

### 4. Product Hunt Launch (FREE)
**Strategy:** One big authentic launch

**Post:**
"GG LOOP - Gaming rewards platform that doesn't exploit you
Built by Filipino-American solo founder
No crypto, no BS, just fair rewards"

**Why it works:**
- Tech community loves ethical builds
- One launch = permanent visibility
- Links to your site forever

**Setup:** 10 minutes (I'll write the post)

### 5. Indie Hackers / Hacker News (FREE)
**Strategy:** Share building journey

**Posts:**
- "Building a gaming SaaS as anti-VC statement"
- "How I got 500 users with $0 marketing"
- "Filipino representation in gaming tech"

**Why it works:**
- Developers love authentic solo founder stories
- Links drive traffic
- Community supports ethical builds

**Setup:** I'll write the posts, you post once

- 30-50 clicks
- First viral tweet (maybe)

**Week 3:**

**Week 4:**

## WHY THIS WORKS (And Doesn't Look Like Bot)

**You're telling YOUR story:**
- Filipino-American identity ✅
- Healing inner gamer ✅
- Anti-exploitation stance ✅
- Community-first values ✅

**It's AUTHENTIC because it's TRUE.**

Bots can't fake that. Algorithms reward it.
