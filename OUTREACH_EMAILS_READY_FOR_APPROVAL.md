## EMAIL #1: LOGITECH G (PRIORITY TIER 1)

### PRIMARY EMAIL

**To:** creators@logitech.com  
**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - GG LOOP × Logitech G  
**Attach:** Logitech_Pitch_Deck.pdf

```
Hi Logitech G creators team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - a gaming rewards platform where competitive players earn real gear for the grind.

Quick context:
• 2,000+ gamers actively upgrading their setups
• Strong peripheral interest (mice, keyboards, headsets - your products)
• Filipino-American founder, former hoops player, gaming grinder
• Honest brand: manual fulfillment, real rewards, no crypto/NFT nonsense

Why Logitech G:
Your gear is what our community wants. They're grinding ranked, upgrading setups piece by piece, and Logitech G is the go-to brand. We can reward that grind with the exact products they're already researching.

Here's what makes this interesting:
We're building a "Choose Your Sponsor" onboarding system - when players sign up, they pick a brand sponsor (like signing an NIL deal). They become "Logitech Rookies," earn brand-specific points, unlock exclusive Logitech rewards, and rep your colors on their profile.

It's player identity meets brand loyalty. NBA free agency for gamers.

What I'm proposing:
30-day "Setup Grind" pilot:
• Gaming missions (any game, any rank)
• Top 50 players earn Logitech G peripherals (mice, keyboards)
• Creator amplification (unboxing videos, setup tours)
• Full conversion tracking (who redeems, what they choose, social reach)

What you get:
• Direct access to setup-upgrading gamers (purchase-intent demographic)
• Real-time metrics (engagement, redemptions, conversions)
• Creator amplification (unboxing content from our community)
• Zero upfront cost - pilot basis only

Not asking for a massive commitment. Just a 15-minute call to explore what this could look like.

Available this week?

Best,
Jayson BQ

Hi Target partnerships team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - a gaming rewards platform for budget-smart gamers.

Why Target:

Here's what makes this interesting:
We're building a "Choose Your Sponsor" system - players pick a brand when they sign up (like NIL deals for gamers). They become "Target Rookies," earn Target-specific points, unlock exclusive Target rewards, and build their player identity around your brand.

What I'm proposing:
30-day "Target Run" pilot:
• Gaming missions (all games, all platforms - broad appeal)
• Top 150 players earn Target gift cards ($10-$50 range)
• Social amplification (TikTok, Discord, "I earned this grinding ranked")
• Full redemption tracking (who redeems, what they buy with it, conversion data)

What you get:
• Gaming demographic insights (who they are, what they play, how they engage)
• Gift card to gaming purchase conversion data (do they buy more games? snacks? gear?)
• Social amplification metrics (TikTok views, Discord mentions, organic reach)
• Zero upfront cost - pilot basis only

Not asking for a massive commitment. Just a 15-minute call to explore what this could look like.

Quick context:
• 2,000+ gamers (18-34 demographic, creator economy overlap)
• Direct cash rewards = highest perceived value
• Filipino-American founder, gaming grinder

Why Cash App:

**Attach:** Nike_Pitch_Deck.pdf

```
Hi Nike partnerships team,

I'm Jayson, founder of GG LOOP (ggloop.io) - a gaming rewards platform for the hoops + gaming generation.

Quick context:
• 2,000+ gamers who also love basketball
• Strong Filipino-American community (huge Nike loyalty - we grew up in Nikes)
• We're the intersection of NBA 2K grind and sneaker culture
• Filipino-American founder, former hoops player, gaming grinder

Why Nike:
Our community lives at the crossover of basketball and gaming. They're playing NBA 2K, grinding ranked, and rocking Nikes while they do it. We see an opportunity to reward that grind with the gear they already want.

30-day "Hoops Grind" pilot:
• Players earn points playing basketball games (NBA 2K, etc.)
• Top performers unlock Nike rewards (gift cards, exclusive drops)
• We track engagement, redemptions, social amplification
• You get data on gaming demographic + cultural reach

What you get:
• Access to 2k+ basketball gamers (18-34 demographic, sneaker culture)
• Filipino-American community activation (underserved market, high Nike loyalty)
• Real-time metrics (clicks, conversions, social mentions, cultural impact)
• Zero upfront cost - pilot basis only
