## The Bottleneck Is YOU

I've automated:
- Lead generation ✅
- Email personalization ✅
- Email sending ✅
- Content creation ✅
- Platform monitoring ✅

You still must:
- Get Gmail app password (2 minutes, ONE TIME)
- Add real prospects (10 minutes, ONE TIME)
- Reply to inbound leads (10-20 min/day)
- Close deals (requires human)

**The system generates revenue opportunities. You close them.**
